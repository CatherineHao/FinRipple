The FDA grants priority review to medicines and vaccines that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment or prevention of a serious condition. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of April 1, 2022.

""VAXNEUVANCE has the potential to provide meaningful protection against invasive pneumococcal disease for children and infants by targeting pneumococcal strains, or serotypes, that contribute to substantial disease burden, including serotype 3, and broadening coverage to additional disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F, which are not included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) currently available for this population,"" said Dr. Roy Baynes , senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories . ""We look forward to working with the U.S. FDA as it reviews what would be the first new option in pediatric pneumococcal vaccination in over a decade.""

The sBLA is supported by results from Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies in pediatric populations including infants, children, and adolescents. These studies support the potential use of VAXNEUVANCE in a variety of clinical settings, including immunization of infants and toddlers as well as of special populations at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, such as children with HIV infection or sickle cell disease. The submission also includes data supporting the potential use of VAXNEUVANCE as part of a mixed dosing regimen following initiation of an infant vaccination schedule with PCV13 as well as in a catch-up setting for older children who are either pneumococcal vaccine-naïve or who previously received a partial or full regimen of a lower-valency pediatric PCV.

Invasive pneumococcal disease can cause serious and potentially life-threatening infections in infants and children. Children under the age of 2 are particularly vulnerable to pneumococcal infection, and incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease remains highest in the first year of life. There are 100 different types of pneumococcal bacteria, of which some continue to put children at risk, including serotypes 22F, 33F and 3, which represent more than a quarter of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under the age of 5.

About VAXNEUVANCE (Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine)

VAXNEUVANCE, Merck's 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, consists of purified capsular polysaccharides from S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F individually conjugated to CRM(197) carrier protein. VAXNEUVANCE is indicated for active immunization of adults 18 years of age and older for the prevention of invasive disease caused by the S. pneumoniae serotypes contained in the vaccine. It is currently under investigation in the pediatric population. VAXNEUVANCE previously received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in pediatric patients 6 weeks through 17 years of age.

Select Safety Information for VAXNEUVANCE in Adults 18 Years of Age and Older

Do not administer VAXNEUVANCE to individuals with a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of VAXNEUVANCE or to diphtheria toxoid.

Some individuals with altered immunocompetence, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a reduced immune response to VAXNEUVANCE.

The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in individuals 18 through 49 years of age were: injection site pain (75.8%), fatigue (34.3%), myalgia (28.8%), headache (26.5%), injection site swelling (21.7%), injection site erythema (15.1%) and arthralgia (12.7%).

The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in individuals 50 years of age and older were: injection site pain (66.8%), myalgia (26.9%), fatigue (21.5%), headache (18.9%), injection site swelling (15.4%), injection site erythema (10.9%) and arthralgia (7.7%).

Vaccination with VAXNEUVANCE may not protect all vaccine recipients.

Halley, whose appointment took effect Nov. 29, most recently served as controller of the government-sponsored firm, which guarantees mortgage loans. She joined Fannie Mae in 2006. In her new role, Halley succeeds Celeste Brown , who resigned in May to become finance chief at Evercore, the financial services firm. David Benson , Fannie Mae's president, served as interim CFO prior to Halley's appointment. (kristin.broughton@wsj.com; @kcbroughton)

1653 ET - The former finance chief of a suburban Chicago-based logistics company was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison for his role in an accounting and securities fraud scheme. A federal jury in July convicted Peter Armbruster, the former CFO of Downers Grove, Ill.-based Roadrunner Transportation Systems, with four counts of violating securities laws. Armbruster, who left Roadrunner in April 2017, inflated the company's income during 3Q 2016 by misrepresenting expenses, according to federal prosecutors. Neither the company nor a lawyer representing Armbruster immediately responded to requests for comment. (kristin.broughton@wsj.com; @kcbroughton)

1634 ET - The federal judge weighing a $4.5B settlement between Purdue Pharma and Sackler family members who own the company says she wants briefing over whether the owners abused the bankruptcy system. Judge Colleen McMahon of the Southern District of New York raised the question about the Sacklers at the end of a court hearing yesterday. Judge McMahon says her concerns relate to more than $10B Purdue distributed to the Sacklers from 2008 to 2017, a couple years before the company filed chapter 11. Judge McMahon said she's ""struggling"" with whether she should consider those distributions while weighing whether to approve legal releases that would shield Sackler family members from civil litigation. She asked lawyers involved in the case to file briefs by Monday morning. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

1627 ET - The Virginia bankruptcy court that oversaw the liquidation of Toys R' Us and restructurings of other national retail chains announced it will start randomly assigning judges to major chapter 11 cases. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia announced its new procedures a week after a New York bankruptcy court said it will broaden random judge assignments for major bankruptcies. Randomizing judge assignments prevents law firms from steering big cases to their preferred judges. In recent years, law firms have guided corporate bankruptcies to Richmond which has two judges. The Virginia court said large cases will now be randomly assigned to judges regardless of where it's filed within the district, which covers the cities of Richmond, Alexandria, Norfolk and Newport News. The change goes into effect Feb. 15. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

1624 ET - Over two years after launching a procurement process, Canada said it has whittled down the list of bidders eligible to supply the country's air force with 88 new fighter jets. Canada said Lockheed Martin , with its F-35, and SAAB AB , with its Gripen aircraft, are the finalists. Canada's public-services department, which is in charge of the procurement process, said the finalists were chosen after a thorough assessment, including a focus on potential economic benefits across the country. Canada intends to award a contract next year, with anticipated delivery of fighter jets in 2025. A decision by Canada to purchase new fighter jets has dragged on for over a decade, after plans unveiled in 2010 to buy 65 F-35s were mired in political controversy.

1611 ET - Firearm industry stocks all turn negative after the FBI reports a 21% drop in background checks in November from a year earlier, though the sales proxy is still up 15% from its pre-pandemic level. Smith & Wesson , which reports quarterly results Thursday, declines alongside Sturm, Ruger and Vista Outdoor . While 4Q has traditionally been a slow season for sales, Black Friday was again the busiest day for checks this year and slightly above the 2020 level. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)

1605 ET - US stocks end sharply lower following a choppy day of trading after the US identified its first Omicron-variant case, in California. Markets may still also be digesting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell opening the door yesterday to an interest-rate rise in 1H, along with a second day of testimony alongside Treasury Secretary Yellen. Oil prices erase early gains on demand worries, while the 10-year Treasury yield slips to 1.42%. Salesforce.com falls 11% on a disappointing 4Q earnings outlook. The Dow sinks 1.3% to 34022, the S&P 500 loses 1.2% to 4513 and the Nasdaq drops 1.8% to 15254. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1536 ET - Barclays now believes the Fed will raise rates three times in 2022 and slow the pace of asset buying faster than is currently planned. But the firm also notes that even as the Fed raises rates, money markets remain flooded with cash, which could blunt the impact of the policy shift. ""With reserves balances over $4 trillion and nearly $1.5 trillion in the [reverse repo facility,] we expect it will be difficult for short-term interest rates to trade much above the interest rate floor,"" says the investment bank.(michael.derby@wsj.com)

1506 ET - Moderna shares are down 10% after it loses part of its court appeal seeking to invalidate patents held by another company, Arbutus Biopharma. Moderna wanted to invalidate Arbutus' patents claiming the invention of tiny drug-delivery particles. Moderna uses similar technology for its Covid-19 vaccine, which it says is proprietary. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Wednesday decided some of the Arbutus patent claims should be struck down but left others intact. Analysts say that could leave Moderna exposed to patent-infringement litigation resulting in Moderna paying royalties on sales of its Covid-19 vaccine to Arbutus, though resolving it may take years. Moderna said it is confident that its vaccine is not covered by the Arbutus patent claims. Arbutus is up 41%. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

1439 ET - GM's CFO expects the auto maker to return to normal production levels by the end of 2022 as the computer-chip shortage eases. Paul Jacobson said the chip crisis has been less severe in 4Q. He expects 1Q next year to be similar, and then foresees gradual improvement in chip availability through the year. (mike.colias@wsj.com; @MikeColias)

1356 ET - S&P Global Economics estimates a US government shutdown could cost real 4Q GDP growth around $1.8B, annualized, for each week it runs and add to 4Q inflation. ""Though risk of a shutdown is high, Congress may reach a new agreement on funding the government by the deadline,"" S&P says, adding ""another short continuing-resolution reprieve only brings a possible shutdown fight closer to the debt ceiling debates."" If the US government were to default, S&P says, it ""would be substantially worse than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008,"" adding such an event would cause the US economy to fall back into a recession.

""The depth and experience of our professional and managed services teams along with their hands-on approach to building customized solutions for our customers is at the heart of our recent string of wins with the federal government.""

DOE issued the EIS awards to Verizon in two components, voice and data. On voice, Verizon will incorporate new technologies and services to help meet DOE's next-generation voice requirements, which include a transition from their Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) voice platform to IP-enabled voice services. The varying task orders will allow Verizon to provide service to all existing DOE locations as well as any future sites.

Verizon was also awarded a task order for data services, which include Optical Wave Service (OWS), Ethernet Transport Service (ETS), Private Line Service (PLS), Internet Protocol Service (IPS), and Virtual Private Network Service (VPNS). In addition to supporting DOE's headquarters facility in Washington, D.C. with enterprise IT services, Verizon will also engage with DOE Program Offices, Power Marketing Administrations, Plants, Site Offices, and National Laboratories with mission-specific services across CONUS locations and some OCONUS facilities located in England, Hawaii and Japan.

This award with DOE comes following a series of other EIS awards for Verizon , including Naval District Washington, the U.S. Department of Labor and the Air National Guard.

Verizon Communications Inc . (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world's leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $128.3 billion in 2020. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers' demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.

PHOENIX, Dec. 1, 2021

PHOENIX, Dec. 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Republic Services, Inc . (NYSE: RSG) today announced the opening of the Sacramento area's first organics pre-processing facility, which will help local communities divert food waste from landfills and turn it into renewable energy. A new California state law, SB 1383, aimed at combating climate change takes effect Jan. 1, 2022, and will require the majority of California homes and business to recycle food and yard waste at facilities such as this one.

""Republic Services is proud to offer solutions to support California's climate goals and the effort to recycle food waste,"" said Mike Caprio, area president. ""As one of the largest recyclers and composters in the state, we continue to invest in infrastructure that will help our customers reduce their impact and provide a circular solution.""

Diverting food and yard waste to recycling programs has a dual benefit: This organic material can be recycled by converting it into renewable energy or a product like compost, and diversion reduces emissions. To meet the requirements of the new state law, CalRecycle estimates that the state will need to double its current organics materials management infrastructure.(1)

Republic's new facility accepts food waste collected from businesses in Sacramento County. The operation removes contamination such as plastic bags and produces clean organic material that is delivered to an anaerobic digestion facility. This facility converts the organic material into renewable energy that is used to power the facility, and, ultimately, could be sold to the public utility grid.

The new Sacramento facility is capable of processing 40,000 pounds of food waste per hour. This is Republic's third organics pre-processing operation, all of which are in California. The Company also owns and operates six composting facilities in the state. In 2020, the Company processed more than 2.15 billion pounds of food and yard waste.

Republic Services was named 2020 Organics Recycler of the Year by the National Waste & Recycling Association , a recognition of the Company's innovation and leadership. Organics recycling directly supports Republic's sustainability goal to increase recovery and circularity of key materials from the waste stream by 40% by 2030.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In nCino 's public disclosures, nCino has provided non-GAAP measures, which are measurements of financial performance that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. In addition to its GAAP measures, nCino uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results. For the reasons set forth below, nCino believes that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our operating results, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures. 


   -- Stock-Based Compensation Expenses. nCino  excludes stock-based 
      compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that 
      nCino  excludes from our internal management reporting processes. nCino 's 
      management also finds it useful to exclude these expenses when they 
      assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource 
      allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. 
      Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, 
      subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can 
      use, nCino  believes excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows 
      investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core 
      business operating results and those of other companies. 
 
   -- Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. nCino  incurs amortization expense 
      for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of 
      certain businesses and technologies. Because these costs have already 
      been incurred, cannot be recovered, are non-cash, and are affected by the 
      inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations, nCino  excludes 
      these expenses for our internal management reporting processes. nCino 's 
      management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing 
      the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource 
      allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. 
      Although nCino  excludes amortization expense for purchased intangibles 
      from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for 
      investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part 
      of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. 
 
   -- Acquisition-Related Expenses. nCino  excludes expenses related to 
      acquisitions as they limit comparability of operating results with prior 
      periods. We believe these costs are non-recurring in nature and outside 
      the ordinary course of business. 
 
   -- Fees and Expenses Related to the Antitrust Matters. nCino  excludes fees 
      and expenses related to the government antitrust investigation and 
      related civil action disclosed in our SEC filings as we do not believe 
      these matters relate to the operating business and their exclusion from 
      non-GAAP operating expenses will facilitate a more meaningful explanation 
      of operating results and comparisons with prior period results.

Press Release: nCino  Reports Third Quarter Fiscal -4-

There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by nCino 's management about which items are adjusted to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures. nCino compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in its public disclosures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. nCino encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables below.

""We remain on-track to deliver an excellent performance in 2021, with a full-year EPS forecast that continues to represent currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 14%,"" said Jacek Olczak , Chief Executive Officer. ""We are seeing strong IQOS momentum despite the ongoing impact of the semiconductor supply shortage and expect improved sequential IQOS user growth in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we remain confident in our 2021 to 2023 organic compound annual growth targets.""

2021 Full-Year Forecast

PMI revises its full-year reported diluted EPS forecast, for currency only, to a range of $5.74 to $5.79, at prevailing exchange rates, from a range of $5.77 to $5.82 previously. On an adjusted basis, this forecast represents a projected currency-neutral increase of 13% to 14% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $5.17 in 2020, as outlined in the table below.

In light of recent currency volatility, the company is providing a directional indication of the potential unfavorable currency impact next year. Applying prevailing exchange rates to anticipated 2021 full-year adjusted diluted EPS would imply an estimated unfavorable impact of around $0.40 per share. PMI will provide its 2022 full-year diluted EPS forecast in February.

2021 Full-Year Forecast Assumptions

The assumptions underlying this forecast remain unchanged versus those communicated by PMI in its earnings release of October 19, 2021, with the exception of a favorable currency impact of $0.14 per share, at prevailing exchange rates, compared to $0.17 per share, previously.

This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated or unquantifiable asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments pertaining to the judgment in the two Québec Class Action lawsuits and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection granted to PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc . (RBH), any unusual events, any intensification of the global shortage of semiconductors and the related impact on the supply of our electronic devices, and any COVID-19-related developments different from the assumptions set forth in the company's forecast.

Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

Forward-Looking & Cautionary Statements

This press release, the presentation and related discussion contain projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.

PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.

In addition, PMI's business risks also include risks and uncertainties related to PMI's acquisitions of Fertin Pharma A/S (""Fertin""), OtiTopic, Inc. (""OtiTopic"") and Vectura Group plc (""Vectura""), including, amongst other things: (1) the possibility that the integration of the operations of Fertin and Vectura with those of PMI may be more difficult and/or take longer than anticipated, and may not accelerate PMI's desired entry into additional smoke-free and beyond nicotine platforms as quickly as anticipated; (2) the possibility that the respective integrations of Fertin and Vectura into PMI may be more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to Fertin, Vectura or PMI's existing businesses; (3) the inability to gain access to or acquire differentiated proprietary assets, technology and/or pharmaceutical development expertise as anticipated by these acquisitions; (4) risks associated with third-party contracts containing consent and/or other contractual provisions that may be triggered by the acquisitions; (5) the success of the research and development efforts of Fertin, OtiTopic and Vectura, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for new products, and the ability to commercialize or license these new products; (6) any unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns and the impact of identified concerns associated with the products developed by Fertin, OtiTopic and Vectura; and (7) the ability to retain key personnel of Fertin and Vectura, or hire key talent to work in the Fertin and Vectura businesses.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption, and resulted in closures of stores, factories and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, all of which will adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position during the continuation of the pandemic. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Currently, significant risks include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our reduced-risk products, significant volume declines in our duty-free business and certain other key markets, disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain, increased currency volatility, and delays in certain cost saving, transformation and restructuring initiatives. Our business could also be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for

1 Dec 2021 06:40 ET 
Press Release: Philip Morris International Inc . -2-

our mid-price or premium-price brands. Continuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs. Governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business. In addition, messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products on COVID-19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products, negatively impact demand for our products, the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our reduced-risk products and our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products.

The impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, its recurrence in our key markets, actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects, and the ultimate economic consequences thereof.

PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.

Philip Morris International : Delivering a Smoke-Free Future

Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. In addition, versions of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of IQOS and its consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products and oral nicotine products. As of September 30, 2021, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets in key cities or nationwide, and PMI estimates that approximately 14.9 million adults around the world have already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.

Sproule, Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters said, ""New Jersey is uniquely positioned as a hub for offshore wind, and we are pleased that our skilled tradespersons are at the forefront of this exciting movement to bring greater energy sustainability to our State.""

""We applaud Atlantic Power Transmission's commitment to the Operating Engineers as they embark on the monumental task of bringing homegrown renewable energy to our electrical grid,"" commented Greg Lalevee, Business Manager of IUOE 825. ""Our union is proud to be part of building a clean energy future in the state of New Jersey.""

Richard Sweeney , President and Business Manager of the Iron Workers Local 399, also stated, ""We are proud to partner with Blackstone Infrastructure and Atlantic Power Transmission on ensuring good paying union jobs for years to come in this important and growing sector of our economy.""

The entire route of the project will utilize underground electric transmission lines to minimize its social and environmental impacts. The project enters onshore at an existing industrial site and aims to avoid disrupting New Jersey's beachfront communities.

Andy Geissbuehler, APT's CEO, stated, ""We highly value our union partnership and our collaboration with the communities along the clean energy corridor. We are committed and able to manage the risks to safely and reliably construct and operate a compelling transmission solution to support New Jersey's clean energy leadership.""

Blackstone is committed to supporting renewable energy and working closely with its union partners. Since 2019, Blackstone has committed nearly $10 billion in investments that it believes are consistent with the broader energy transition.

In September 2021, Blackstone announced that the Champlain Hudson Power Express (""CHPE""), an underground electric transmission line spanning 339 miles between Canada and New York City, was selected by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority as part of an extensive RFP process to deliver 1,250 MW of clean, renewable power to New York City. CHPE is expected to create 1,400 jobs, with a commitment to use union labor, and includes a $40 million new Green Economy Fund that will provide job training for clean energy jobs.

In November 2021, Blackstone portfolio companies, Altus Power, a leading clean electrification company, and Link Logistics, operator of the largest portfolio of strategic last mile locations in the US, were awarded approximately 35 MW of community solar projects in New Jersey. Together, Altus and Link will build and operate a portfolio of rooftop community solar projects to serve approximately 10,000 residential customers throughout New Jersey with renewable energy.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16, 2021

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP today launched an investigation into the recent recall of aerosol spray antiperspirants and hygiene products made by The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG).

The Procter & Gamble Company manufactures, distributes, and sells antiperspirants, deodorants, and body sprays under several brands names, including Old Spice and Secret. On November 3, 2021, pharmaceutical testing laboratory Valisure filed a Citizen Petition requesting the Food and Drug Administration initiate a recall of certain Procter & Gamble products due to the presence of dangerous levels of benzene.

Benzene is classified as a human carcinogen. Exposure to benzene can result in cancers including leukemia and blood cancer of the bone marrow, and also blood disorders which can be life-threatening.

On November 23, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration announced that Procter & Gamble is voluntarily recalling all lots with expiry through September 2023 of specific Old Spice and Secret products sold in the United States due to the high levels of benzene detected.

The recalled products include: 


   -- Old Spice High Endurance AP Spray Pure Sport 12/6oz 
 
   -- Old Spice Hardest Working Collection Inv Spray Stronger Swagger 3.8oz 
 
   -- Old Spice Hardest Working Collection Inv Spray Pure Sport Plus 12/3.8oz

   -- Secret Aerosol Powder Fresh Twin Pack 
 
   -- Secret Aerosol Powder Fresh 12/6OZ 
 
   -- Secret Aerosol Powder Fresh 12/4OZ 
 
   -- Secret Fresh Collection Inv Spray Waterlily 3.8oz

   -- Secret Outlast Inv Spray Completely Clean 12/3.8oz 
 
   -- Secret Outlast Inv Spray Protecting Powder 12/3.8oz

1008 ET - AB InBev is introducing a line of Bud Light-branded hard sodas, the latest crossover venture as alcohol and soft-drink companies push into one another's turf. Consumer demand has soared over the past few years for lightly-flavored hard seltzers. Now some consumers are migrating toward stronger flavors. Hard sodas represent a tiny fraction of the beer market. Not Your Father's Root Beer was popular in 2015 and 2016, but hard sodas have since taken a back seat to hard teas, says Harry Schuhmacher, publisher of Beer Business Daily. ""To me, that means a gap has opened for a sweet-tasting offering in the hard cola space,"" he says. AB InBev ADRs gain 2.3% to $59.30. (jennifer.maloney@wsj.com; @maloneyfiles)

0959 ET - Steel Dynamics expects adjusted 4Q earnings in a range of $5.69. to $5.73 a share, edging above analysts' forecast of $5.58 a share. The guidance excludes the steelmaker's continuing costs for the construction of a new steel mill in Texas and other charges. Without those exclusions, the company expects to earn $5.46 to $5.50 a share. Investors Wednesday subjected steelmaker Nucor to a big selloff after its 4Q guidance fell short of expectations. Steel Dynamics ' shares up 4.8% to $61.74 in early trading. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)

0949 ET - The Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog wants an examiner to provide an independent review of the restructuring Johnson & Johnson undertook before putting a new subsidiary responsible for thousands of talc injury lawsuits into bankruptcy. US Trustee Andrew R. Vara said Wednesday in a filing in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey that an independent party needs to review Johnson & Johnson 's use of a Texas statute to perform a divisional merger shortly before its subsidiary was put into chapter 11. Vara said the strategy Johnson & Johnson used raises the question of whether such divisional mergers ahead of chapter 11 filing are permissible under the bankruptcy code. A handful of divisional mergers have been done in a handful of prior asbestos cases filed in North Carolina, which unlike other jurisdictions like New Jersey, is not part of the US Trustee system. The request for an examiner must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

0944 ET - Costco Wholesale will continue to order early from its suppliers, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti says. ""Where we can, we order early,"" Galanti said, adding that the retailer is facing delays as well as temporary shortages of certain items. Costco expects inflation will remain elevated in 2022, even though other issues, including product shortages, will likely subside as the year progresses. ""Overall, our best guess is 4.5% to 5%,"" he said, referring to the company's inflation forecast for 2022. ""One of the things that probably won't subside is labor cost increases,"" Galanti said. The company in late October raised its starting wage for workers to $17 an hour, eating into its profits. Costco 's net sales rose 17% to $49.4B during the latest quarter. Net income was $1.3B, up from $1.2B the prior year. (nina.trentmann@wsj.com; @Nina_Trentmann)

0830 ET - Single-aisle jets will make the majority of the planes that will be delivered over the next 20 years, aviation-data provider Cirium forecasts.

""The core of this $1.6 trillion [single-aisle jets] market continues to be the 150-seat size aircraft, typified by the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max 8, which will make up 50% of deliveries,"" it adds.

0736 ET - While the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has slowed bookings in international markets where travel restrictions are in place, Delta Air Lines says holiday travel demand remains strong.

Delta says its total revenue in the fourth quarter is 74% recovered to 2019 levels, above its previous expectations. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

0502 ET - Kering's sales are set to grow further in the year's final quarter, driven by leading brand Gucci's recovery in China and continued momentum in the U.S., Bryan Garnier's Loic Morvan says. The French luxury-goods group should post 2021 sales of EUR17.09 billion, 10% more than in 2019, according to Bryan Garnier's estimates; this would imply 21% two-year growth in 4Q, picking up speed from 12% in 3Q. This acceleration will be driven by Gucci, whose CEO in November signalled full-year revenue in line with 2019, meaning 6% two-year growth in 4Q from 6% lower the previous quarter, Morvan notes. The brand's recovery in mainland China after a tough summer should be abetted by continued momentum in the U.S., with the new Aria collection helping spur sales, Morvan says.

The New York-based company said it is moving quickly to push additional antibodies that appear effective against both the Omicron and Delta variants into clinical testing by the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory discussions. Shares of Regeneron fall 2.8%. Regeneron's Covid treatment is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that is administered in a hospital or clinic intravenously to people who are already infected with Covid-19. Currently monoclonal antibody treatments are the only drugs authorized to treat patients, before they require hospitalization, who are at high risk of developing severe cases.

As both oils are used in similar products, they often trade in tandem. The benchmark contract for March delivery rises MYR84 to MYR4,350 a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange.

0225 GMT - Chinese steel rebar futures rise in early trade amid expectations that Beijing's production curbs will keep a lid on supplies, Moody's says. It expects China to maintain the strict production controls as it looks to meet carbon emission-reduction targets. However, steel price gains may be capped amid weakening demand from the country's faltering property sector, it says. That said, Moody's expects steel demand from Korea, Australia and India to remain robust going into 2022. The most-traded May steel rebar contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange is 1.0% higher at CNY4,464 a ton. (yongchang.chin@wsj.com)

0214 GMT - Copper is higher in early Asian trading after mining company MMG says its Las Bambas copper mine in Peru, among the world's largest copper mines, will halt copper production on Dec. 18 due to transport disruptions. The company says ongoing dialogue with local communities has been unsuccessful ""with no resolution reached to remove the roadblocks,"" adding to fears of a continued hit to global supplies of the industrial metal. Stockpiles on the site are estimated at 60,770 tons of copper concentrate, MMG says. The three-month LME copper contract is 1.6% higher at $9,350 a ton. (yongchang.chin@wsj.com)

0055 GMT - Gold is little changed in early Asia trading, following an overnight decline that was weighed by the U.S. Fed's plans to speed up its tapering of bond purchases, Oanda says. A higher potential for three interest-rake hikes next year, with an additional three in 2023, are also on the cards, Oanda says. The precious metal's ""weakness could be near its end as the Fed will be on autopilot until the March policy meeting,"" Oanda adds. Spot gold is flat at $1,777.47/oz. (justina.lee@wsj.com)

2214 GMT - Iluka Resources ' larger-than-expected Wimmera resource and assumed Phase 2 mine expansion prompt Goldman Sachs to raise its price target on the stock by 8% to A$11.90/share. Iluka says the Wimmera deposit in the state of Victoria contains more than 1 million tons of rare earth oxides and 10.6 million tons of zircon. ""The Wimmera deposit is an important part of Iluka's rare earth growth strategy which includes the Eneabba high grade reserve and planned Eneabba Rare Earth Refinery (ERER) in Western Australia,"" says Goldman, which rates Iluka at buy. Goldman thinks the Wimmera deposit and ERER will cost A$1.3 billion to build, with a final investment decision on the latter taken in February 2022. Iluka is down 0.4% at A$9.94 early on Thursday.

2039 GMT - Bank of Nova Scotia says currency traders were badly served by Statistics Canada 's November CPI report which it argues badly understates inflation in the country. It says unlike the US and UK, Canadian inflation data do not incorporate used-car prices. Some private-sector data suggest those costs in Canada rose 9.5% in November. Bank of Nova Scotia calculates that, based on how the US incorporates used-car prices in its CPI basket, Canadian inflation rose closer to 6% in November. ""The issue is hugely important at a time of heightened sensitivity toward inflationary pressures,"" Bank of Nova Scotia says. ""Markets and mainstreet businesses are not being served by this ongoing omission."" (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

1924 GMT - Most actively traded gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,770.60 a troy ounce Wednesday after Federal Reserve officials signaled they could raise interest rates at least three times next year to combat inflation. Officials also decided to accelerate their pace of scaling back pandemic stimulus efforts. Analysts said rate hikes and faster tapering could drag down gold. Higher rates make it less appealing to hold gold because investors don't earn any income on it. Gold, held by some investors as a hedge against inflation, has fallen from five-month highs despite a sharp run-up in inflation. ""Gold prices could remain under some pressure until we see the reality of rate hikes,"" George Milling-Stanley, chief gold strategist at State Street Global Advisors tells WSJ. (Hardika.Singh@wsj.com; @hardikasingh28)

1846 GMT - Natural gas prices finish 1.5% higher at $3.802/mmBtu, ending a two-day streak of declines. The higher prices may be partly due to expectations that cold, winter weather is bound to start becoming the norm over the coming week or so, which should help boost demand and reduce inventories. But very mild weather in November and early December so far means the next one or two weekly storage reports are still likely to see bearishly small declines. For tomorrow's EIA storage report, a WSJ survey is forecasting just an 85B cubic feet decline in inventories, compared with the five-year-average fall of 114 bcf for that week. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1845 GMT - US benchmark oil prices finish slightly higher, up 0.2% at $70.87 a barrel despite trading in the red for most of the session. Brisk selling of the commodity marked the beginning of the trading day due to omicron worries and as investors feared a Fed decision to quicken its taper could strengthen the dollar, which often sends oil prices lower. But a mid-session weekly EIA report provided price support as it showed bullish declines in US inventories of crude, gasoline and diesel fuels. And while the Fed decision indeed strengthened the dollar, oil prices rose, too, on the idea the Fed is confident the economy is growing and the pandemic may be ending. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1840 GMT - Recent policy decisions by China have put some weight on US livestock futures trading on CME , with live-cattle futures finishing down 1.3% to $1.36575 a pound, while lean-hog futures closed down 0.9% to 79.325c. In the case of both cattle and hogs, new policy decisions made by China were bearish influences on futures, independent trader Dan Norcini says. ""For the cattle--news that China will begin accepting imports of Brazilian beef once again, dented demand optimism here in the US since China has been buying very large amount of US beef in recent weekly export reports,"" Norcini says. ""In the hogs, it was news that China will raise tariffs on imported pork beginning next year from its current 8% to 12%."" (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

1739 GMT - WTI oil prices erase most of their earlier declines, trading 0.4% lower at $70.43 a barrel. Investors are awaiting a Fed policy decision at 2 pm ET that could see the central bank becoming more aggressive in reducing its bond-buying, which could be a precursor to raising interest rates next year. Theoretically, oil prices could fall in such a scenario, as it could strengthen the dollar which often moves inversely to oil prices since crude is bought and sold in greenbacks. But other factors are also at play, including the possibility that such a Fed decision may send a signal that the pandemic is ending, which could boost oil prices. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0435 GMT - Among Australian iron-ore stocks, Morgan Stanley thinks investors would be wise to back producers of high-grade material. It favors Rio Tinto and Deterra Royalties over Fortescue Metals and Mineral Resources, partly because it expects China's emission controls to support a medium-term shift to higher-grade products. Also, Morgan Stanley says Rio Tinto 's shares have ""corrected significantly following several production downgrades and capex increases, that are now well reflected in the stock price.""

Among the companies that help investors trade and manage their money, Bank of America sees the most promise in the stocks of firms that make alternative investments, such as the Blackstone (BX). And brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) are well-positioned to gain as Robinhood struggles.

Bank of America thinks alternative asset managers have strong growth ahead as investors look to expand their horizons beyond plain-vanilla stocks and bonds. Companies like Ares Management (ARES), a top alternative asset manager, put money into private equity, credit, and real estate strategies that are becoming more popular.

Among alternative managers, Bank of America likes Ares, Blackstone, and Carlyle Group (CG). They will be able to raise money easily, while also withstanding market downturns because their assets are often locked into investments for longer periods.

""Given the robust capital market backdrop, we expect strong fund raising, investing and realizations to support positive earnings revisions and stock performance into 2022 but also note that the alts are defensive (locked-up assets under management, fixed fees on committed, dry powder) if the macroeconomic backdrop deteriorates,"" Siegenthaler wrote.

Other areas could be more challenged. Exchanges, for instance, look expensive. ""We view overall valuations as somewhat rich relative to growth prospects which prevents us from becoming more bullish,"" Siegenthaler wrote. That said, he has Buy ratings on Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Tradeweb Markets (TW).

Traditional asset managers could also feel pressure, because the government stimulus payments and market liquidity that boosted them during the pandemic won't last forever.

And brokers are likely to have a mixed year, too. Companies that earn substantial net interest income from customer deposits like Schwab could be in for big gains as interest rates rise.

Siegenthaler has Buy ratings on Schwab and Interactive Brokers (IBKR), which he thinks has ""the strongest organic growth prospects in our coverage through its broad offering for active traders, retail, brokers, financial advisors, hedge funds and prop traders globally.""

Robinhood, whose zero-commission model ushered in a new wave of retail stock and options trading, could be in for tougher times, Siegenthaler argues, initiating coverage with an Underperform rating and a $22 price target. After an early surge following its late-July initial public offering, Robinhood has tumbled.

The stock made its debut at $38 but has lately been trading below $20. On Thursday, it was down 7.2% to $18.09.

Robinhood's third-quarter report was remarkably weak -- the company lost customers on net after record customer growth in the first half of the year. The setup for next year looks worrisome, because ""the benefits from the perfect storm created by the pandemic are now reversing at the same time its main revenue driver (PFOF -- payment for order flow) is being investigated by the SEC,"" Siegenthaler wrote.

He expects ""the company may not turn a profit for several years.""

Robinhood declined to comment on the Bank of America report.

J.P. Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington also sees trouble ahead for Robinhood, though he expects customer growth to improve in the fourth quarter. The biggest weight on shares now appears to be selling pressure from insiders looking to cash out, he wrote. And that pressure may not go away soon.

""Our research has indicated that selling by insiders, former convertible share owners, and pre-IPO investors has been the bigger driver of the share price declines,"" he wrote. ""With pre-IPO investors with still material gains, we see the potential for more selling should market conditions deteriorate and/or Robinhood fundamentals continue to not live up to expectations provided to the investment community as part of its IPO.""

Worthington rates the shares at Underweight with a $17 price target.

""Where we can, we order early,"" Galanti said, adding that the retailer is facing delays as well as temporary shortages of certain items. Costco expects inflation will remain elevated in 2022, even though other issues, including product shortages, will likely subside as the year progresses. ""Overall, our best guess is 4.5% to 5%,"" he said, referring to the company's inflation forecast for 2022. ""One of the things that probably won't subside is labor cost increases,"" Galanti said. The company in late October raised its starting wage for workers to $17 an hour, eating into its profits. Costco 's net sales rose 17% to $49.4B during the latest quarter. Net income was $1.3B, up from $1.2B the prior year. (nina.trentmann@wsj.com; @Nina_Trentmann)

0830 ET - Single-aisle jets will make the majority of the planes that will be delivered over the next 20 years, aviation-data provider Cirium forecasts. They should represent 70% of the roughly 45,000 planes that Cirium expects to be delivered world-wide by 2040, and 55% of the total value, Cirium says. ""The core of this $1.6 trillion [single-aisle jets] market continues to be the 150-seat size aircraft, typified by the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max 8, which will make up 50% of deliveries,"" it adds.

0736 ET - While the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has slowed bookings in international markets where travel restrictions are in place, Delta Air Lines says holiday travel demand remains strong. Delta says the new variant has had ""limited impact"" and raises its fourth quarter guidance, citing unit revenue that is coming in ahead of 2019 levels. Delta says its total revenue in the fourth quarter is 74% recovered to 2019 levels, above its previous expectations. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

0502 ET - Kering's sales are set to grow further in the year's final quarter, driven by leading brand Gucci's recovery in China and continued momentum in the U.S., Bryan Garnier's Loic Morvan says. The French luxury-goods group should post 2021 sales of EUR17.09 billion, 10% more than in 2019, according to Bryan Garnier's estimates; this would imply 21% two-year growth in 4Q, picking up speed from 12% in 3Q. This acceleration will be driven by Gucci, whose CEO in November signalled full-year revenue in line with 2019, meaning 6% two-year growth in 4Q from 6% lower the previous quarter, Morvan notes. The brand's recovery in mainland China after a tough summer should be abetted by continued momentum in the U.S., with the new Aria collection helping spur sales, Morvan says.

0234 ET - The FTSE 100 is expected to open 80 points higher at 7250, according to CMC Markets , after upbeat trading in Asia and on Wall Street. Markets in China, Hong Kong and Japan gain and the Dow Jones rose 1% after the U.S. Fed accelerated its tapering program to $30 billion a month, starting January as expected, while adopting a slightly more hawkish outlook toward rising inflation, CMC says. ""As such today's European market session looks set to be a strong one, and with the Fed meeting now in the rear-view mirror, all attention now turns to today's European Central Bank and Bank of England decisions,"" CMC analyst Michael Hewson says.

US Trustee Andrew R. Vara said Wednesday in a filing in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey that an independent party needs to review Johnson & Johnson 's use of a Texas statute to perform a divisional merger shortly before its subsidiary was put into chapter 11. Vara said the strategy Johnson & Johnson used raises the question of whether such divisional mergers ahead of chapter 11 filing are permissible under the bankruptcy code. A handful of divisional mergers have been done in a handful of prior asbestos cases filed in North Carolina, which unlike other jurisdictions like New Jersey, is not part of the US Trustee system.

Modern giving trends amid the pandemic infographic. (Graphic: Wells Fargo )

Millennials lead the way in new forms of giving, with nearly three out of five (57%) having donated via newer channels, versus 49% of Gen X and 34% of Boomers. And regardless of age, a full 79% of respondents said they appreciate these newer ways to give. At times, the plethora of options to give and higher expectations to be charitable adds pressure to Americans, with half (50%) admitting they have a hard time saying no when somebody asks them to give. This is especially true of younger Americans (62% of Gen Z, and 58% of Millennials).

Giving Trends Influenced by the Pandemic

The effects of the pandemic can be seen in people's level of charitable giving, with 57% saying it has changed their giving levels. Almost half (46%) say they are giving more because of the pandemic, and 11% reported giving less. Two out of three Americans (67%) sometimes feel like they do not give enough, and more so for Millennials (74%) and Gen Z (76%).

""Almost everyone surveyed (95%) say that giving makes them feel good, and the pandemic has accentuated opportunities to give,"" said Arne Boudewyn , head of family wealth and culture services at Wells Fargo Bank within the Wealth & Investment Management division. ""In addition to reporting monetary gifts, it's also heartening to see nine out of 10 try to practice random acts of kindness. Philanthropy isn't always about money, but often is simply a mindset.""

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 

About half of the younger generations want to donate their time rather than money (52% of Gen Z and 48% of Millennials). Overall, one in three Americans would rather donate their time instead of money (64% vs 36).

Philanthropy: Not just for Millionaires

While many people have donated to individuals, groups, or charities this year -- with 59% donating an average of $1,300 in 2021 -- most do not consider themselves to be a philanthropist. Eighty-five percent of those surveyed believe philanthropy isn't just for millionaires, yet only 28% consider themselves to be one.

The term ""philanthropist"" might have higher-dollar connotations for people, but taking into account newer and smaller channels of giving, like social media, checkout lines, and other channels included in the survey, an estimated one in three Americans (30%) report they are probably giving more than they think.

Planning your Giving

As with all things financial, making and sticking to a budget can be just as challenging when it comes to giving. Just under three in ten (29%) have planned intentions with their donations each year, while 71% often give in the spur of the moment, or if they feel ""moved to give."" Only 14% have a yearly budget for donations, and just 31% do any research on the causes they support.

""Overall, these findings show a positive trend in community support. But it's important to understand as much as you can about the charities you support, and it can be really helpful to plan out a giving strategy -- particularly if you are making these donations as a family. Researching charities and planning a giving strategy can be a great way to engage with younger members of the family and help instill the value of generosity,"" said Boudewyn. ""With more than 87% of respondents having grown up understanding the value of generosity, those are clearly values passed on through the generations. Whether you do so at the grocery store line, social causes, or through a foundation, your support and work is important.""

The New York-based company said it is moving quickly to push additional antibodies that appear effective against both the Omicron and Delta variants into clinical testing by the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory discussions. Shares of Regeneron fall 2.8%. Regeneron's Covid treatment is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that is administered in a hospital or clinic intravenously to people who are already infected with Covid-19. Currently monoclonal antibody treatments are the only drugs authorized to treat patients, before they require hospitalization, who are at high risk of developing severe cases.

0949 ET - The Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog wants an examiner to provide an independent review of the restructuring Johnson & Johnson undertook before putting a new subsidiary responsible for thousands of talc injury lawsuits into bankruptcy. US Trustee Andrew R. Vara said Wednesday in a filing in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey that an independent party needs to review Johnson & Johnson 's use of a Texas statute to perform a divisional merger shortly before its subsidiary was put into chapter 11. Vara said the strategy Johnson & Johnson used raises the question of whether such divisional mergers ahead of chapter 11 filing are permissible under the bankruptcy code. A handful of divisional mergers have been done in a handful of prior asbestos cases filed in North Carolina, which unlike other jurisdictions like New Jersey, is not part of the US Trustee system. The request for an examiner must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

0442 ET - Novartis shares rise by 4.2% Thursday morning after it announced a $15 billion share buyback, funded by the recent sale of its long-held stake in crosstown rival Roche for $20.7 billion. Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said the buyback provided a bonus for shareholders while also leaving some room for small acquisitions to bolster Novartis 's pipeline. Novartis shares are up 3.8% at CHF77.84. (denise.roland@wsj.com ; @deniseroland)

0349 ET - Novartis 's decision to launch a $15 billion buyback isn't the best way to use the cash from the sale of its stake in Roche, Bryan Garnier analysts say. The Swiss pharmaceutical company is using the vast majority of the about $21 billion sum for the buyback, and BG says it could have channelled more cash towards buying new drugs, companies or technologies to support future growth. A 50/50 split between buybacks and M&A would have been better, the European investment bank says. ""We are a bit disappointed by this use of proceeds since it has been well known for 20 years that for the pharmaceutical sector, buying back shares does not lead to a sustainable rerating of the share,"" BG says. (cristina.roca@wsj.com; @_cristinaroca)

0328 ET - Novartis 's planned buyback should be welcomed since it leaves room for M&A activity, analysts at Jefferies say. The Swiss pharmaceutical company is to buy back up to $15 billion in own shares by the end of 2023, using part of the proceeds from the recent sale of its stake in peer Roche. The cash return to shareholders nevertheless leaves Novartis with cash for bolt-on acquisitions over the same period, Jefferies says, pointing to cardiovascular and oncology players as among the likely targets. The investment bank has a buy rating and a CHF95 target on the stock, which trades 3.5% higher at CHF77.61 following the news. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

2316 ET - Concerns around CSL's US$11.7 billion takeover of Switzerland-based specialty drug maker Vifor Pharma look overdone to Morgans. The investment bank acknowledges that the strategic rationale may be hard for some investors to get their heads around, and perhaps wonder if CSL's core plasma business could struggle to keep growing. ""But we believe this is misplaced as this deal looks as unique as CSL itself, allowing access to a defensible specialty product portfolio with strong market positions and growth opportunities, far from a 'typical' pharma transaction,"" says Morgans, which rates CSL as add.

1442 ET - Adagio Therapeutics ' reporting a reduction in in-vitro neutralizing activity of ADG20 against the Omicron variant limits Stifel's level of comfort, the firm says in downgrading shares to hold from buy. The data substantially alters the fundamental risk profile of the company for ongoing clinical development, commercial differentiation, and future capital requirements and accessibility, Stifel says. While the expected continuation of the Phase 2 and 3 development programs ""would suggest there is still a salvageable path forward here, we believe successfully executing these programs ... against the backdrop of epidemiological uncertainty currently characterizing the Omicron variant creates an unpalatable risk profile which limits our ability to remain constructive here,"" Stifel says. Shares slump 15% after steeper declines the previous session. (michael.dabaie@wsj.com)

1415 ET - A New Jersey bankruptcy judge says he'll give a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary interim approval to retain Jones Day to keep working on its chapter 11 case concerning personal injury claims over the company's talc-based products. Jones Day 's retention is being challenged by a Justice Department watchdog and representatives for injury claimants who argue the law firm's past representation of Johnson & Johnson creates a conflict of interest that prevents the firm from representing the subsidiary, which was put into bankruptcy earlier this year in an effort to settle talc litigation. Judge Michael Kaplan of the US Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey said he'll approve the Jones Day retention ahead of a January hearing where he'll consider the merits of the challenges.

Out of those CFOs, 72% rated the current North American economy as good, down from 78% in 3Q, and 45% expect conditions to be better a year out, a decline from 54%. Talent and labor concerns continue to dominate internal risks, while inflation and supply chain ranked as chief external risk concerns. Three-quarters of CFOs expect the Fed to raise the target interest rate for US federal funds to range between 0.26% and 1%. Nearly half expect it to occur in 2Q.

1319 ET - A Redfin survey says eight of its 10 hottest neighborhoods of 2022 are in Florida, and seven of those are in the Sarasota metropolitan area. The other two areas are Chatham on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, and Lake Lure, NC. Local Redfin real estate agent Eric Auciello says, ""Many of the towns surrounding Sarasota are exploding in popularity because so many people are getting priced out of Sarasota proper or moving in from out of state to work remotely and take advantage of the sunshine, low taxes and relative affordability."" Redfin points out that a majority of the places in this annual list also face substantial risk from storms, flooding and heat, a reality house hunters should consider as the effects of climate change intensify.

1314 ET - A strained labor base and material delivery delays stemming from supply-chain disruptions have extended the time it takes to deliver a home to a customer, Lennar Co-CEO Jonathan Jaffe says on an earnings call. ""These disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies,"" he says. ""It continues to be a game of whack a mole."" These factors have caused 4Q cycle times to increase by an additional two weeks from 3Q, rising to a range of four to six weeks over the past year, he says. Lennar expects to deliver about 12,500 homes in 1Q, shy of analysts' consensus target of 14,700 homes, per FactSet. Lennar falls 3.5% to $109.15. (kimberly.chin@wsj.com; @mskimberlychin)

1251 ET - General Dynamics ' Gulfstream unit says it is cooperating with authorities looking into what caused a Gulfstream GIVSP plane that took off yesterday from an airport in the Dominican Republic to crash, killing all nine people on board. The country's aviation regulator, in a tweet, says it instructed a flight-safety commission to investigate. The flight operator, Helidosa Aviation, also said it was cooperating with regulators. Last year, the accident rate for flights in the Caribbean and Latin America ticked up compared with 2019, according to a safety report the International Air Transport Association released earlier this year. One of those killed on the flight destined for Florida was music producer José Hernández, who worked with well-known musicians like Bad Bunny under the name Flow La Movie, according to news reports.

1238 ET - First-time homebuyers are now increasingly looking for flex space such as finished basements, guest rooms and guest houses, a Realtor.com survey shows. These home shoppers have also increased their budgets since the spring, and are more willing to bid over asking price and use other tactics to get ahead of the competition. The survey found that while more than a quarter of hopeful first-time homebuyers were unsuccessful at purchasing a home in 2021, 72% are aiming to try again in 2022. And after months of trying, home shoppers have a better understanding of what it will take to write a winning offer, including putting more than 20% down and making an offer quickly.

1142 ET - Morgan Stanley says AT&T 's recent selloff, which sent shares to two-decade lows, reflects ""an overly negative outlook"" that ignores this year's wireless revenue growth. The investment bank also flags upside from the pending WarnerMedia -Discovery merger, which will give AT&T shareholders a stake the venture. ""Part of the challenge with investing in AT&T right now is that there are a lot of unanswered questions on deal structure, timeline, etc. which should all become clearer in coming months."" AT&T will report 4Q results Jan. 26, and other news from tax treatment to 5G auction results could come sooner. Morgan Stanley lifts its recommendation on the stock to overweight from equal-weight and lowers its price target to $28, down from its old $32 level. AT&T gains 6.6% to $23.64.

1138 ET - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals says that its REGEN-COV antibody cocktail has diminished efficacy against Omicron, confirming preliminary testing indicating that the treatment doesn't work as well against the new variant. The New York-based company said it is moving quickly to push additional antibodies that appear effective against both the Omicron and Delta variants into clinical testing by the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory discussions. Shares of Regeneron fall 2.8%. Regeneron's Covid treatment is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that is administered in a hospital or clinic intravenously to people who are already infected with Covid-19. Currently monoclonal antibody treatments are the only drugs authorized to treat patients, before they require hospitalization, who are at high risk of developing severe cases.

1008 ET - AB InBev is introducing a line of Bud Light-branded hard sodas, the latest crossover venture as alcohol and soft-drink companies push into one another's turf. Consumer demand has soared over the past few years for lightly-flavored hard seltzers. Now some consumers are migrating toward stronger flavors. Hard sodas represent a tiny fraction of the beer market. Not Your Father's Root Beer was popular in 2015 and 2016, but hard sodas have since taken a back seat to hard teas, says Harry Schuhmacher, publisher of Beer Business Daily. ""To me, that means a gap has opened for a sweet-tasting offering in the hard cola space,"" he says. AB InBev ADRs gain 2.3% to $59.30. (jennifer.maloney@wsj.com; @maloneyfiles)

Without those exclusions, the company expects to earn $5.46 to $5.50 a share. Investors Wednesday subjected steelmaker Nucor to a big selloff after its 4Q guidance fell short of expectations.

0949 ET - The Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog wants an examiner to provide an independent review of the restructuring Johnson & Johnson undertook before putting a new subsidiary responsible for thousands of talc injury lawsuits into bankruptcy. US Trustee Andrew R. Vara said Wednesday in a filing in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey that an independent party needs to review Johnson & Johnson 's use of a Texas statute to perform a divisional merger shortly before its subsidiary was put into chapter 11. Vara said the strategy Johnson & Johnson used raises the question of whether such divisional mergers ahead of chapter 11 filing are permissible under the bankruptcy code. A handful of divisional mergers have been done in a handful of prior asbestos cases filed in North Carolina, which unlike other jurisdictions like New Jersey, is not part of the US Trustee system. The request for an examiner must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

Previously, the parent-company bondholders had alleged that Intelsat's directors chose a chapter 11 plan that unfairly rewarded a competing creditor group. Judge Keith L.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. & PROVO, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 15, 2021-- 

ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) and Qualtrics (NASDAQ: XM) today announced the availability of new joint capabilities that enable companies to deliver personalized service experiences. Combining ServiceNow 's digital workflows with Qualtrics ' experience management technology, organizations can harness and act on customer and employee experience data on the Now Platform, in real time, to quickly resolve issues and improve engagement, loyalty, and retention.

""What it means to truly know your customer has changed. Organizations need to deliver empathy at mass scale in every interaction to retain customers and drive growth in 2022,"" said Michael Ramsey, VP, Customer Workflow Products at ServiceNow . ""Access to rich customer insights allows agents to respond to individual needs and powers digital workflows that drive great experiences, customer loyalty, and empathy.""

""Great experiences are the currency of modern business. The experiences that companies deliver today can become their greatest competitive advantage tomorrow,"" said Jay Choi, Chief Product Officer at Qualtrics . ""Companies who understand and act on experience data--the feedback that employees and customers share with them--to deliver incredible service experiences will successfully build long-term, meaningful relationships.""

Setting a new standard for personalized service experiences at scale

Many organizations still struggle with siloed systems and disconnected customer insights that hamper their ability to design and deliver experiences customers want. Yet, providing great customer experiences is key to retention and growth. According to research from Qualtrics and ServiceNow , 80% of respondents said they have switched brands because of poor customer experience, and poor customer service experiences were the number one reason why.

To address this challenge, organizations can now access additional customer experience data from Qualtrics on the Now Platform via the Qualtrics CustomerXM(TM) and ServiceNow Customer Service Management integration. The data will empower service teams to create personalized workflows and automate support experiences, increasing loyalty and spend while helping reduce operational costs.

""Today people increasingly expect their banks to provide personalized experiences across every interaction,"" said Nicolas Boesch, GVP of Voice of Customer at M&T Bank . ""Our use of ServiceNow and Qualtrics has enabled us to improve customer satisfaction at critical touchpoints, including our contact centers, retail locations and digital channels. We look forward to using the new Qualtrics and ServiceNow integration to help further streamline our processes and uncover new ways to delight our customers.""

Organizations can also now seamlessly use the Qualtrics EmployeeXM(TM) for IT and ServiceNow IT Service Management integration to improve employee satisfaction and engagement. The integration helps IT teams automate and measure personalized service experiences based on employee experience data, while reducing operational costs. This is critical - Qualtrics research shows that employees are 230% more engaged at work if they believe they have the right IT services and technology supporting them.

""The digital services and tools that employees use for work are pivotal to the overall employee experience in today's hybrid workplace. When employees are enabled with the right technology at work they are happier and more productive,"" said Bob Border, CIO, Ingredion Incorporated. ""The Qualtrics and ServiceNow integration will enable our IT department to identify and close experience gaps that improve employee satisfaction, productivity and engagement.""

Innovating together for future service experiences

Qualtrics and ServiceNow will continue to jointly innovate to deliver more meaningful, tailored experiences in 2022. Additional integrated capabilities will help teams visualize sentiment and profile data directly on the Now Platform, giving agents and frontline teams a more holistic view of the customer and employee to improve service experiences.

Availability 


   -- Customers can access the Qualtrics CustomerXM(TM) and ServiceNow  CSM, and 
      Qualtrics EmployeeXM(TM) for IT and ServiceNow  ITSM, integration on the 
      ServiceNow Store and the Qualtrics  Marketplace today. 
 
   -- Visualization of sentiment and customer and employee profile details, 
      along with visualization of satisfaction insights and stakeholder 
      feedback, are expected to be available in 2022.

Rules issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in November require employers with 100 or more workers to ensure employees are vaccinated or take weekly Covid-19 tests by Jan. 4.

Whether those rules, which were targeted by lawsuits across the country, will take effect is uncertain. Last week, a U.S. court blocked the plan to mandate vaccines for federal contractors. General Electric Co. and others have since suspended vaccine requirements for employees. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati is considering whether to reinstate the administration's rules for employers.

Kroger's monthly surcharge applies to salaried employees, and doesn't apply to hourly employees enrolled in the company's health plan, or those represented by labor unions. About 66% of its workforce is unionized.

Kroger joins an increasing number of employers adding surcharges for unvaccinated employees. Delta Air Lines Inc. in August added a $200 monthly surcharge to its healthcare plan to alleviate the financial burden stemming from the pandemic. The carrier said it saw early signs of success, with the number of employees receiving their first Covid-19 shot tripling from the typical daily rate.

The board of Nevada Public Employees' Benefits Program voted this month to add surcharges for state employees, retirees and their dependents who are unvaccinated. Employees and retirees under the state's health plan are subject to a $55 monthly surcharge, under policies set to go into effect in July, and dependents are subject to a $175 monthly surcharge. More than 4,000 out of 23,000 state employees remain unvaccinated, said Laura Rich, executive officer of the state's public employees benefits program.

The program's board decided that the financial costs of tests and hospitalizations should be shifted to people who refuse to be vaccinated, Ms. Rich said, adding that the board views the surcharge to be the only method available to encourage vaccinations.

Supermarkets rely on hundreds of thousands of front-line workers, but most haven't enforced a vaccine or test mandate or changed their policies. Industry executives have said they are hesitant about making big changes, fearing workers may quit if required to get vaccinated or tested weekly. They have also said costs continue to rise for labor and transportation.

A Kroger spokeswoman said the company is modifying policies to encourage safe behaviors as it prepares to navigate the next phase of the pandemic, and that the changes are designed to create a healthier workplace and workforce. She said the company considered feedback from employees and customers to guide its policies, and that Kroger will continue to encourage sick employees to stay home and seek the support of a physician if they contract the coronavirus. Unvaccinated employees can take paid time off or apply for unpaid leave, she said. Kroger has been motivating staffers to get vaccinated with a $100 payment.

Kroger's Covid-19 policy changes don't apply to employees with approved medical or religious accommodations, according to the memo. The company said in the memo that it continues to prepare and develop responses to OSHA's Covid-19 vaccine requirement.

Taking away paid Covid-19 sick leave is risky because many hourly wage workers likely don't have the savings to stay at home, said Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, which describes itself as nonpartisan. She said infected employees who needed income could go to work and endanger other employees and customers.

""We are almost two years into the pandemic, but we are not out of the woods,"" Ms. Kinder said, given the spread of the Omicron variant.

The retail industry has faced monthslong labor shortages. Some store workers have quit because they switched industries or were worried about spreading or contracting Covid-19 in public settings, industry executives have said. Others have stayed out of the job market because of child-care duties or savings they accumulated during the pandemic.

Many grocery chains have been offering payments to encourage vaccinations. Companies have also kept plastic barriers at cash registers, are encouraging social distancing, and are sanitizing stores more frequently than they did before the pandemic. Most have ended hazard pay for workers in stores and warehouses. Mask policies for employees remain across many supermarket chains, though some stores have struggled to manage customers who show up without face coverings or refuse to wear them properly.

Adding a surcharge can be an effective way to encourage vaccinations because people are risk-averse when facing losses, said Helen Leis, a partner at consulting firm Oliver Wyman Inc. who advises companies on pandemic responses. At the same time, she said, the penalty has to be large enough to get employees' attention.

""Folks who are choosing not to be vaccinated are very dedicated to their decisions,"" Ms. Leis said.

If consumers don't understand a bank's overdraft terms, it has no incentive to compete for their business on those terms. Economic theory suggests banks should want to implement and disclose attractive overdraft protection policies to win customers. Regulators like Mr. Chopra should be mindful of how diktats that raise the costs of serving a market can discourage precisely the type of competition he says he wants to foster.

Evidence from the money-transfer market illustrates that when firms compete to serve consumers -- particularly those without bank accounts, or the ""unbanked"" -- good things can happen. Walmart announced in October that its money-transfer service had saved consumers $2.4 billion in fees since 2014.

Before Walmart's entry into the money-transfer business, consumers typically could use MoneyGram or Western Union in a Walmart store. For transfers of up to $900, these incumbent firms charged fees ranging from $4.75 to $76, with higher fees for higher transfer amounts. When Walmart entered the market in 2014, it priced its money-transfer services as much as 87% below the competition. MoneyGram and Western Union were forced to cut their prices. The competition benefited even those who preferred the brand-name offerings. What's more, the price reductions likely resulted in substitutions away from riskier and more cumbersome methods of payment, such as physically carrying large amounts of cash from one place to another. When the cost of transferring money goes up, people increasingly rely on high-interest payday or title loans.

Competition protects the unbanked from high fees, providing them with cheaper access to needed financial services. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., there were 7.1 million unbanked households in 2019, generally in low-income communities. These consumers are the ones who use money-transfer services, whose high fees can bring serious hardships. Competition among banks allows those without credit cards and checking accounts to send cash and pay bills more cheaply. The savings are even more valuable today, as inflation has soared to a 39-year high, making it harder for everyone, but especially financially vulnerable Americans, to afford food, gasoline and many other everyday needs.

Competition is always the best protection against high prices, whether in the form of overdraft fees or any other financial service. And it's already happening without the government's help. Reports this summer that many major banks have altered overdraft programs to be more transparent and affordable ought to please Mr. Chopra. Regulatory mandates actually discourage competition by making disruptive entry more expensive. If the CFPB, other agencies and Congress really want to help consumers of financial services, they should do what they can to foster competition.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Fidelity National Information Services, Inc . (FIS) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Positive due to the company's recent announcement it will increase spending on M&A and capital returns in the coming years.

FIS announced in November 2021 an updated capital allocation policy, indicating it will invest more heavily for growth through organic investments and M&A and will increase spending on dividends and buybacks.

The ratings and Outlook impact approximately $20 billion of outstanding debt as of September 2021.

Key Rating Drivers

Capital Returns: Fitch views the recently revised capital allocation policy as a factor that could keep leverage higher than previously expected and likely at or near 3.0x on run-rate basis, although it could move higher with material M&A and/or opportunistic share repurchases. FIS is very strongly positioned at its current IDR and should be able to manage this degree of leverage, with strong FCF and a relatively stable business model. FIS announced in November 2021 it would prioritize growth investments, with an emphasis on new solutions to accelerate growth and expand its TAM. The company also will grow its dividends per share 20% per year and has plans to use excess cash flow for share repurchases.

Worldpay Integration: Fitch believes FIS is on track with integrating its $42 billion Worldpay acquisition completed in July 2019. FIS and Worldpay had overlapping areas that enabled meaningful opex synergies projected at more $475 million by YE 2021 (higher than and well in advance of an original 2022 target for $400 million) as well as annual interest savings of $400 million. Management also highlighted revenue synergies approaching a $700 million run-rate, including new bank referral agreements and cross-sell wins with solutions such as premium payback.

Commitment to Investment Grade Ratings: Fitch believes FIS is committed to IG ratings at least at the 'BBB' level and targets gross leverage near 3.0x. Fitch calculates gross leverage will be near 3.0x at Dec-21 on roughly $20 billion of debt, versus 2.8x at December 2018 (prior to the Worldpay deal announcement). Fitch estimates FIS could generate $2.5-$3.0 billion of post-dividend FCF in 2022-2023, which should support its debt position while also enabling shareholder returns. Fitch believes FIS will maintain reasonably conservative credit metrics over time given bank regulators review the financial stability of vendors such as FIS that sell products and services into banks.

Coronavirus Impact: Fitch believes FIS has largely recovered from the pandemic-related impacts on its business, but risks remain due to the ongoing health crisis. FIS was most heavily impacted in its Merchant Solutions segment, but trends improved YTD with Merchant revenue up 13% in 3Q21. Other parts of its business were less meaningfully impacted due to long-term contracts in place. On a consolidated basis, FIS projects revenue to grow 10%-11% and EBITDA 16%-18% in 2021, signaling improved trends across its business.

Stable Market Demand: Fitch believes FIS's technology solutions are mission-critical for its customers, as evidenced by its market presence, long-term contracts and high renewal rates. Customer engagements are typically secured by long-term contracts (five years on certain core products) and high renewal rates (over 90%). This provides meaningful visibility into future revenue and cash flow and is further evidenced by consistent organic revenue growth at least in the low-single digit range over the past decade. Results during 2020 further reflect this stability with an organic revenue decline of only 1%. Worldpay revenues are less contractual than the legacy FIS, but we believe Merchant segment is also fairly stable.

Outsourcing Trends: FIS benefits from outsourcing trends that Fitch believes will continue in the coming years. Banks and other financial institutions will likely continue relying on third party technology suppliers to focus on core competencies, streamline processes, and reduce costs. Regional banks are facing the most pressure to outsource as they try to keep pace with the technology investments of the big banks and are falling behind community banks that have already made the decision to outsource. Fitch also believes FIS's complete portfolio, now further bolstered with Worldpay, is a competitive advantage as customers consolidate vendors.

Scalable Business: EBITDA margins could expand further over the intermediate term, helped by strong incremental margins inherent in the business. Reported EBITDA margin is projected to be 44%-45% in 2021, or up 220-240 basis points YoY and materially above 29%-30% in 2011. Worldpay had much higher margins near 50%, which boosts consolidated margins. Margins have also benefited from Worldpay cost synergies, a continued shift toward more SaaS sales and exiting of certain lower margin businesses (e.g., Capco).

Growth via Acquisitions: Fitch expects FIS will continue to pursue inorganic growth via acquisitions. FIS has completed multiple deals of scale historically, including its 2019 purchase of Worldpay and its 2015 acquisition of SunGard for $9.1 billion. The company historically increased leverage for large acquisitions, but it has also shown willingness to use equity for deals as it did with Worldpay, SunGard , and Metavante (2009) acquisitions.

Derivation Summary

Fitch's ratings and Outlook for FIS are supported by the company's high mix of recurring revenue, sticky customer base, market leadership in its core businesses, and predictable cash flow generation. Rating constraints include pricing compression in the space that could limit margin expansion over time and acquisition risk surrounding large-scale M&A.

FIS was historically successful at driving synergies with large deals, including Worldpay and SunGard . Nonetheless, future M&A bears various risks (e.g., integration, customer losses, financing, etc.) that could impact ratings over time. Inclusive of these risks, Fitch believes the company's operating fundamentals including stable/growing EBITDA & margins, low leverage, and strong FCF generation position FIS well within the 'BBB' rating category.

Key Assumptions

--Revenue increases in the mid-single digit growth over the ratings horizon, including mid-single digit growth across each of the segments; higher in 2021 & 2022 in parts of business due to recovery from pandemic.

--EBITDA margins expand 20-30 basis points per year, supported by greater scale, synergies, among other items.

--Capex is near 9% of revenue over the ratings horizon.

--Buybacks remain a primary use of CF absent any additional M&A.

--Dividend spend grows by mid- to high-teens per year, with per share growth offset by a lower share count.

--Gross debt/EBITDA remains near 3.0x over the ratings horizon.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:

--FCF leverage, Fitch-defined as FCF to Total Debt with Equity Credit, sustained above 12%.

--Gross leverage, defined as Total Debt with Equity Credit to EBITDA, expected to be sustained below 3.0x.

--Organic revenue growth at least in the mid/high-single digit percentage range, signalling improving core trends.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:

--Gross leverage above 3.5x for a sustained period without a credible de-leveraging plan.

--FCF leverage sustained below 9%-10%.

--Post-dividend FCF margins that trend toward mid-single digit as a percentage of revenue.

--Significant changes to the structure of the fintech sector or disruption from emerging technologies.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579  .

Liquidity and Debt Structure

Strong Liquidity: FIS has a high degree of liquidity, which benefits the overall IDR. Specifically, the company has the following liquidity sources as of September 2021:

--$1.4 billion of cash;

--A $5.5 billion senior unsecured revolver;

--Strong post-dividend FCF generation that was $2.4 billion in 2020 and Fitch calculates could be $2.5 to $3.0 billion per year in 2021-2023. Both legacy FIS and Worldpay have long histories of positive and meaningful FCF throughout the cycle;

--A $5.5 billion USD commercial paper program;

--A $4.7 billion EUR commercial paper program.

Debt Profile with Staggered Maturities, Diverse Funding Sources: FIS is a seasoned investment grade debt issuer with a staggered debt maturity schedule, consisting largely of unsecured bonds (across multiple currencies including USD, EUR and GBP) with maturities ranging from 2022-2048 and a $5.5 billion unsecured revolver. The company had roughly $20 billion of debt outstanding at September 2021, with a weighted average cost of debt of 0.9% including the impact of interest rate swaps.

Press Release: Fitch Affirms Fidelity National -2-

FIS' $5.5 billion USD and $4.7 billion EUR commercial paper (or its equivalent in other currencies) programs and revolver further enhance the company's ability to cost-efficiently manage working capital and growth needs across multiple points of the economic cycle.

Issuer Profile

FIS is a global financial services technology company that provides outsourced banking, payment processing, consulting, and retail and asset management solutions. It serves a diverse mix of 20,000+ banks and financial institutions, over 1 million merchants, and other customers in over 140 countries.

The pullback is in some ways reminiscent of September, when the Delta variant forced numerous companies to cancel their return-to-office plans, upending hopes that there would be a major back-to-office surge following Labor Day.

A reduction in the number of employees returning to work next month would be painful for office-building landlords who have been struggling with high vacancy and uncertainty over the long-term impact of the pandemic. Some analysts suggested that another delayed return to the office would cause more employers to consider remote work longer term.

""The big risk would be if these companies now take a bigger step towards a more work-from-home world,"" said Daniel Ismail, senior analyst at real-estate-analytics firm Green Street.

Sales at restaurants, bars and other small businesses near office buildings have suffered for nearly two years, causing these operators to scramble to make rent payments and keep their operations alive. Some are already reconciling themselves to a poor start to the new year.

""January gets pushed back to February. February will get pushed back to March,"" said Rick Passarelli, owner of a Bobby Van's steakhouse in Midtown Manhattan. ""It keeps getting pushed back.""

While less than half of the office workers have returned in major urban markets, landlords take some solace knowing that the number continues to edge higher. An average of 41% of the workforce was back in the 10 major cities monitored by Kastle Systems in the week after Thanksgiving, a record level since the pandemic hit. Kastle is a nationwide security company that monitors access-card swipes in 10 large cities.

And landlords remain hopeful that any retreat from the office won't be as severe as it was before Labor Day. For one, more Americans are vaccinated now. Currently about 82% of the U.S. population ages 12 and up has had at least one dose, and the rate is much higher in cities such as New York and San Francisco, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compares to only around 62% of the eligible population as the country headed into the Labor Day weekend, the CDC said.

Some businesses also are taking cues from President Biden, who has said no new lockdowns are necessary due to the Omicron variant. He has limited new restrictions mostly to travel rules. Many public events, from football games to Broadway shows, are proceeding.

Wells Fargo & Co. is among the firms pledging to return as planned next month. The bank said last month that it ""will continue to follow the science,"" and it is on track to open its San Francisco headquarters and other locations.

Businesses also recognize that lurching from one workplace strategy to another before the health data support such moves creates uncertainty and hurts credibility, said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.

""It's been back and forth so many times,"" Ms. Wylde said. ""Every one of those reversals increases the lack of trust that anybody knows the right thing to do.""

That concern isn't stopping some companies from delaying or tinkering with their return schedules. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. said it put off plans to bring its senior leadership team to the downtown Hartford, Conn., office during the first week in December. The company said it is still moving forward with a Jan. 18 return-to-office for employees.

Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc., said last week it would fully reopen its U.S. offices at the end of January. But it also said it was implementing a new office deferral program that gives workers the option to delay their scheduled return as late as June.

Other companies have indicated they might delay plans based on new findings related to the Omicron variant. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE said last week that a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests but the two-dose regimen was less effective at blocking the virus.

Report finds more than 77 per cent of consumers in Canada -- and 86 per cent of Gen Z -- are already connecting their bank accounts to technology apps

TORONTO, Dec. 15, 2021 /CNW/ - Mastercard released a new report, The Rise of Open Banking, demonstrating the mainstream adoption of technology to power smarter, more meaningful digital experiences. Open banking puts consumers at the centre of where and how their data is used to more effectively provide the services they want and need. Fintech companies and banks use this consumer-permissioned data to provide easier and more inclusive access to credit, personal financial management, digital wallets and payments services.

Open banking is already embedded in several areas of our daily lives, including personal financial management tools, linking of financial accounts and account opening. According to the report, over nine in 10 consumers (95 per cent) in Canada use online and mobile financial applications to manage money, with paying bills (85 per cent) and banking (84 per cent) as the most popular use cases.

""With the emergence of open banking, the way we as consumers and businesses can connect with and control our data -- for everything from borrowing, investing, and budgeting -- is being redefined,"" said Craig Reiff, Vice President, Core Products and Open Banking at Mastercard in Canada. ""Mastercard 's open banking solutions bring simplicity, efficiency, and security to the financial data experience, while empowering consumers and small and mid-sized businesses to receive more benefits from their data.""

Accelerated Shift to Digital

The survey uncovered that over the past year consumers in Canada have started conducting common transactions digitally including for: 


   -- Securing or refinancing a loan (31 per cent) 
 
   -- Checking or improving their credit score (31 per cent) 
 
   -- Emerging use cases like buying or selling cryptocurrency (54 per cent) 
      and crowdfunding (35 per cent) 

Open banking is at the foundation of many of these applications, where fintech companies, banks and financial institutions are connecting financial data securely and seamlessly to enable a wide range of financial products and services.

Willingness to Connect Financial Accounts

Critical to driving many, if not all, of these transactions is the ability for consumers to securely link their bank or payment accounts and authorize their financial data to be used in online financial applications. The report found that: 


   -- 65 per cent of consumers in Canada have, or would, consider connecting 
      their bank accounts to financial apps and services to automate financial 
      tasks 
 
   -- 69 per cent of consumers in Canadian have, or would, consider connecting 
      their bank accounts to financial apps and services to easily send money 
      to someone 

Trust in Fintech

Consumers are already connecting their data via multiple platforms to manage finances, and thus make their data work harder for them. Of those surveyed: 


   -- 55 per cent of consumers in Canada feel very confident using technology 
      to manage money 
 
   -- Convenience is a top driver for using financial technology, with 62 per 
      cent of consumers in Canada saying fintech saves them time and is less 
      work 

Putting consumers at the centre of how and where their financial data is used ensures greater transparency and in turn helps fintech companies, banks and financial institutions gather feedback, scale faster and create new financial products and services more efficiently. Mastercard is a trusted partner and provides the highest levels of security and protection in every interaction and data transfer, adhering to its own data protection principles and standards: Consumers own the data they produce every day -- and have the right to understand and control how it is shared and used.

Report Methodology:

To better understand the near- and longer-term implications of open banking technology on financial services and the consumer experience, The Harris Poll on behalf of Mastercard conducted an online quantitative survey in Canada and the U.S. among 4,000 respondents aged 18 and older. All participants were screened for credit card use with readable sample by gender, generation, affluence, ethnicity, fintech openness and adoption, card ownership, major bank relationships, region, etc. Fieldwork was conducted May 26 to June 15, 2021.

The company said it is still moving forward with a Jan. 18 return-to-office for employees.

Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc., said last week it would fully reopen its U.S. offices at the end of January. But it also said it was implementing a new office deferral program that gives workers the option to delay their scheduled return as late as June.

Other companies have indicated they might delay plans based on new findings related to the Omicron variant. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE said last week that a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests but the two-dose regimen was less effective at blocking the virus.",",LYFT:XNAS,0A2O:XLON,LYFT:XMEX,LY0:XFRA,LYFT:XWBO,UBER.KZ:XKAZ,UBER:XWBO,UBER:XSWX,UBERUSD:XSWX,UBER.RM:MISX,UT8:XFRA,U1BE34:BVMF,UBER:XNYS,UBER:XMEX,0A1U:XLON,",",zimriu,ubrti,pfiz,onlnfr,nwbc,kassys,itthe,hwmlcb,goog,gognew,frdmo,",",zimriu,ubrti,goog,",",ubrib,",",UBER.KZ:XKAZ,UBER:XWBO,UBER:XSWX,UBERUSD:XSWX,UBER.RM:MISX,UT8:XFRA,U1BE34:BVMF,UBER:XNYS,UBER:XMEX,0A1U:XLON,LYFT:XNAS,0A2O:XLON,LYFT:XMEX,LY0:XFRA,LYFT:XWBO,UBER.KZ:XKAZ,UBER:XWBO,UBER:XSWX,UBERUSD:XSWX,UBER.RM:MISX,UT8:XFRA,U1BE34:BVMF,UBER:XNYS,UBER:XMEX,0A1U:XLON,UBER.KZ:XKAZ,UBER:XWBO,UBER:XSWX,UBERUSD:XSWX,UBER.RM:MISX,UT8:XFRA,U1BE34:BVMF,UBER:XNYS,UBER:XMEX,0A1U:XLON,LYFT:XNAS,0A2O:XLON,LYFT:XMEX,LY0:XFRA,LYFT:XWBO,LYFT:XNAS,0A2O:XLON,LYFT:XMEX,LY0:XFRA,LYFT:XWBO,","Office-building owners and small businesses near such properties are bracing for another letdown in January, as the latest Covid-19 variant threatens to interfere with widespread company plans to return to the workplace.

ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 15, 2021-- 

Exelixis, Inc . (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced initiation of the dose-escalation stage of STELLAR-002, a phase 1b trial evaluating XL092 in combination with immuno-oncology therapies in advanced solid tumors. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of XL092, Exelixis ' novel next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in combination with: nivolumab (OPDIVO(R) ); nivolumab and ipilimumab (YERVOY(R) ); and nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin.

Exelixis is sponsoring STELLAR-002, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) is providing nivolumab, ipilimumab and bempegaldesleukin for use in the trial, in accordance with their clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement announced in June. Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) will supply bempegaldesleukin to Bristol Myers Squibb through their existing global development and commercialization collaboration.

""The initiation of the dose-escalation stage of STELLAR-002, our second phase 1b trial of XL092, is an important step toward evaluating the potential of this next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor in combination with three additional immuno-oncology therapies for patients with advanced genitourinary tumors,"" said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D ., President and Chief Executive Officer, Exelixis. ""We are pleased to continue our successful collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb through this trial and look forward to identifying the recommended doses for the cohort-expansion stage.""

The dose-escalation stage will determine the recommended dose in patients with advanced solid tumors for each of the XL092 combination therapy regimens. Once the recommended dose is established, the trial will begin to enroll tumor-specific expansion cohorts for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint of the expansion stage will be objective response rates, except for the cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, for which the primary endpoint will be duration of radiographic progression-free survival.

About XL092

XL092 is a next-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets kinases implicated in cancer growth and spread, including VEGF receptors, MET, AXL and MER. In designing XL092, Exelixis sought to build upon its extensive experience with cabozantinib, the company's flagship medicine, retaining the target profile while improving key characteristics, including pharmacokinetic half-life. XL092 is currently being developed for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including genitourinary cancers, as a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. XL092 is the first internally discovered Exelixis compound to enter the clinic following the company's reinitiation of drug-discovery activities.

About Genitourinary Cancers

Genitourinary cancers are those that affect the urinary tract, prostate, testicles or penis -- parts of the body involved in reproduction and urine production and excretion -- and include renal cell carcinoma (RCC), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and urothelial carcinomas.(1) 


   -- The American Cancer Society 's (ACS) 2021 statistics cite kidney cancer as 
      among the top 10 most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men 
      and women in the U.S.2 Clear cell RCC is the most common type of kidney 
      cancer in adults.3 Papillary RCC accounts for about 15% of all renal cell 
      cancers.4,5 If detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate 
      for RCC is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC, 
      however, the five-year survival rate is only 13%.2 Approximately 32,000 
      patients in the U.S. and over 71,000 worldwide will require systemic 
      treatment for advanced kidney cancer in 2021, with nearly 15,000 patients 
      in need of a first-line treatment in the U.S.6 
 
   -- According to the ACS, in 2021, approximately 250,000 new cases of 
      prostate cancer will be diagnosed, and 34,000 people will die from the 
      disease.2 Prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and does 
      not respond to androgen-suppression therapies -- a common treatment for 
      prostate cancer -- is known as metastatic CRPC.7 Researchers estimate 
      that in 2020, 43,000 people were diagnosed with metastatic CRPC, which 
      has a median survival of less than two years.8,9,10 
 
   -- Urothelial cancers encompass carcinomas of the bladder, ureter and renal 
      pelvis at a ratio of 50:3:1, respectively.11 Bladder cancer occurs mainly 
      in older people, with 90% of patients aged 55 or older.12 With an 
      estimated 84,000 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2021, bladder 
      cancer accounts for about 5% of all new cases of cancer in the U.S. each 
      year.2,13 It is the fourth most common cancer in men.2

The updated release reads:

EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPROVES MERCK'S VAXNEUVANCE(TM) (PNEUMOCOCCAL 15-VALENT CONJUGATE VACCINE) FOR INDIVIDUALS 18 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today the European Commission (EC) has approved VAXNEUVANCE(TM) (Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine) for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older. The approval allows marketing of VAXNEUVANCE in all 27 European Union (EU ) Member States plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein. The use of VAXNEUVANCE in the EU should be in accordance with official recommendations.

The EC's decision follows a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency 's Committee for Medicinal Products on Human Use (CHMP), which reviewed data from seven randomized, double-blind clinical studies evaluating VAXNEUVANCE in 7,438 individuals from a variety of adult populations and clinical circumstances. These included healthy adults ages 50 years and older, adults ages 18 to 49 with risk factors for pneumococcal disease, and immunocompromised adults living with HIV. In the pivotal, double blind, active-comparator controlled study in 1,205 immunocompetent pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ages 50 and older, immune responses elicited by VAXNEUVANCE were non-inferior to the currently available 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for the 13 shared serotypes, as assessed by opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) at 30 days post-vaccination. Additionally, immune responses for VAXNEUVANCE were superior to PCV13 for shared serotype 3 and for the two serotypes unique to VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F. Randomized controlled trials assessing the clinical efficacy of VAXNEUVANCE compared to PCV13 have not been conducted.

""At Merck, we are committed to helping protect more people from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), as well as from pneumococcal pneumonia, the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults,"" said Dr. Roy Baynes , senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories . ""With VAXNEUVANCE, we developed a conjugate vaccine that elicits a strong immune response to pneumococcal serotypes that contribute substantially to the burden of disease, including serotype 3, a leading cause of IPD in the EU . This approval provides physicians and patients in the European Union with a new option that can help protect against pneumococcal serotypes responsible for around 40 percent of IPD cases in adults over 65 in the largest EU member countries.""

In July 2021, VAXNEUVANCE received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F in adults 18 years and older.

Select Safety Information for VAXNEUVANCE (Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine) in Adults 18 Years of Age and Older in the U.S.

Do not administer VAXNEUVANCE to individuals with a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of VAXNEUVANCE or to diphtheria toxoid.

Some individuals with altered immunocompetence, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a reduced immune response to VAXNEUVANCE.

The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in individuals 18 through 49 years of age were: injection site pain (75.8%), fatigue (34.3%), myalgia (28.8%), headache (26.5%), injection site swelling (21.7%), injection site erythema (15.1%) and arthralgia (12.7%).

The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in individuals 50 years of age and older were: injection site pain (66.8%), myalgia (26.9%), fatigue (21.5%), headache (18.9%), injection site swelling (15.4%), injection site erythema (10.9%) and arthralgia (7.7%).

Vaccination with VAXNEUVANCE may not protect all vaccine recipients.

About Pneumococcal Disease

The global prevalence of pneumococcal disease, an infection caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae, is evolving. Highly aggressive strains, or serotypes, threaten to put more people at risk for invasive pneumococcal illnesses such as bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream); bacteremic pneumonia (pneumonia with bacteremia); and meningitis (infection of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord), as well as non-invasive pneumonia (when pneumococcal disease is confined to the lungs). While healthy adults can suffer from pneumococcal disease, patient populations particularly vulnerable to infection include older adults such as those 65 years of age and older, people with HIV, and those with certain chronic health conditions.

The investment bank sees ""substantial growth opportunity for natural gas driven by continuing EV penetration, with natural gas potentially seeing a cumulative demand increase of 50x between 2020 and 2040 to reach just over 50 billion cubic feet per day."" Cowen also believes transportation will get electric sooner than expected. ""We continue to maintain above-consensus estimates for electric vehicle (EV) penetration at 16% in 2025 vs. market expectations of 13%."" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1041 ET - Exxon Mobil says it will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. The Permian, in West Texas and New Mexico, is a key shale asset for Exxon where it plans to ramp up activity. CEO Darren Woods said at the World Petroleum Congress Monday that Exxon 's investments in electrifying its Permian operations coupled with reductions in methane leaks and flaring of natural gas give Exxon an ""achievable path"" to meet the goal.

1031 ET - Cowen has moved its projections for growth in the cannabis market higher, with the firm increasing its target for total market for cannabis by 2026 to $84B, up from its previous projection of $73B and well up from its initial projection of $50B. The main factor that has kept the cannabis market down is US legislation legalizing cannabis on the federal level, Cowen says. ""We continue to view Washington's legalization of cannabis as a matter of when, not if, and it is conceivable this could happen in 2022, either as a result of bipartisan legislation ahead of the November midterm elections, or potentially in the lame duck period that will begin in November 2022 and end in January 2023,"" says the firm in its latest report.

1009 ET - Brazil's Azul is using its own flight crew to deliver packages to customers, part of efforts to solve the ""last mile"" challenge that have helped its air cargo revenue double from 2019 to 2021. Azul executives, at an investor event, say it's taking share from trucks, mostly from flying cargo in planes' bellies, but also kitting out E1 jetliners with additional fire protection equipment in the cabins that obviate the need for cabin crew to accompany the freight.

1007 ET - Trucker Old Dominion Freight Line reports strong mid-quarter revenue growth on robust freight demand that the carrier says should continue into next year. The LTL operator says revenue per day rose 29.9% YOY in November, reflecting gains in market share and ongoing strength in the domestic economy. The key pricing metric of LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.4% excluding fuel surcharges for the quarter to date from the same period in 2020. CEO Greg Gantt says Old Dominion expects the sequential change in revenue per day for 4Q21 ""will once again exceed our 10-year average for this metric."" (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

0958 ET - Citi projects self-driving truck startup Embark Trucks showing profits by 2024, initiating coverage with a buy rating and $11 share-price target. Citi sees ""compelling"" economics for Embark following its move to public trading through a SPAC merger. The company's autonomous tech can be spread to multiple truck makers, which City says ""provides flexibility and reduces risk."" The report projects revenue reaching $2.6B by 2026 with $1.1B in EBITDA. (paul.page@wsj.com)

0949 ET - Nucor says it will build a small mill to supply steel reinforcing bar to the south Atlantic region. The mill will have an annual capacity of 430,000 tons and cost about $350M to construct, Nucor says. The steelmaker already operates similar regional micro-mills in Florida and Missouri. Rebar is used primarily with concrete in the construction of roads, buildings and sidewalks. ""The East Coast market will be in need of additional rebar supply in the coming years, particularly with the recent passage of the infrastructure spending bill,"" CEO Leon Topalian says. Shares rise 1.8% $112.44. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)

0944 ET - Knight-Swift Transportation buys Midwest Motor Express for $150M, the latest step in the big trucker's push to diversify its business lines and build out a nationwide less-than-truckload network. Knight-Swift bought regional LTL operator AAA Cooper Transportation in July, giving the largest US truckload carrier an LTL foothold in the Southeast and Midwest.

0826 ET - A new study suggests potential for Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine as a ""mix-and-match"" booster shot. The J&J vaccine, when given six months after people received the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine, boosted levels of immune-system antibodies and T-cells in a study at Beth Israel in Boston. The increase in antibodies from the J&J shot was comparable to what a Pfizer booster shot achieved, while it surpassed the Pfizer shot in T-cell responses. It could be a tough sell, however, to convince Pfizer -vaccinated people to get the J&J booster: so far, about 95% of people receiving Pfizer 's vaccine have stuck with the same shot if they got a booster in the US, according to the CDC.

Vivendi , TIM's largest shareholder, previously said it felt a EUR10.8 billion all-share offer from investment company KKR undervalued TIM. According to the reports, Vivendi would now not oppose a spinoff of TIM's infrastructure network, and could even become a minority shareholder in the new business.

The purpose of the collaboration is to evaluate IO Biotech 's lead candidate, IO102-IO103, in combination with KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab), Merck's anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, in previously untreated patients with three different tumor types-- metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). IO102-IO103 is an investigational novel immunotherapeutic agent designed to target the mechanisms mediated by key immunosuppressive proteins such as Indoleamine 2,3-dehydrogenase (IDO) and PD-L1.

""We are pleased to be collaborating once again with Merck to study the potential of our IDO and PD-L1 derived immune-modulating therapy in combination with pembrolizumab as part of our broad, late-stage development program,"" said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD , CEO and founder of IO Biotech . ""We believe IO102-IO103 has the potential to show utility for multiple cancer indications, and we look forward to expanding our dataset in these additional settings.""

The planned Phase 2 trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of IO102-IO103 with pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC, SCCHN, or UBC. Additional correlative endpoints will also be explored to elucidate the mechanism of action. Under the terms of the agreement, IO Biotech will sponsor the Phase 2 trial and Merck will supply pembrolizumab. IO Biotech maintains global commercial rights to IO102-IO103.

About IO102-IO103/IOB-022

Based on the results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, IO102-IO103, in combination with pembrolizumab, was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of unresectable/metastatic melanoma. IO Biotech plans to initiate a Phase 3 combination trial of IO102-IO103 and KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab), as first-line treatment in metastatic melanoma patients which is designed to be potentially registrational for IO102-IO103.

"Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ",",ccat,cscm,neqac,nfiac,npda,npfida,npfxda,npqda,ncat,nfact,",,1638787125000,"J&J's consumer-health unit generated $14.1 billion in sales last year, compared with $45.6 billion for pharmaceuticals and $23 billion for medical devices, according to a filing with securities regulators. The company operated 90 manufacturing facilities globally at the end of 2020.

Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk and his employees have numerous tasks ahead of them, including opening bank accounts for the new company, setting up new financial systems for accounting and reporting, developing employee-benefit plans and selecting an independent auditor, he said. ""All of those things that you might imagine exist today at Johnson & Johnson now have to be replicated for this new company,"" Mr. Wolk said.

The separate firm will market over-the-counter medications and consumer-health goods, while the remaining company will continue selling prescription drugs and medical devices. Those operations are in many cases intertwined. For example, the company generally manufactures pills for over-the-counter medicines and prescription drugs in a similar process in the same type of facility, he said.

""Over decades of being a combined business, things have become very entangled,"" Mr. Wolk said. ""Some of that was for efficiency reasons, others because it just made logical sense.""

Mr. Wolk said he will become CFO of the remaining company. The board is expected to name a new chief executive and finance chief, as well as potentially board members, to lead the new consumer-health business sometime in the first half of 2022, he said.

Deciding which assets fall into which business will require some discretion and judgment, but it is too early to determine how those decisions will be made, he said.

The company recently began ""censusing"" the organization, or reviewing employees' roles in certain operations to determine which of the two companies they would become part of, Mr. Wolk said. An employee is considered part of the new consumer-health business if they currently spend at least 51% of their time working in consumer health, he said. The company had 134,500 employees at the end of 2020.

Dividing up the company's extensive supply chain will take years to complete, likely after the transaction has closed, Mr. Wolk said. J&J expects to manage the supply chain in the interim through transitional service agreements and potentially contract manufacturing arrangements, he said. The remaining business might set up new facilities depending on the number of properties representing its particular business lines, he said.

Companies frequently spin off parts of their business to unlock value. Nearly 150 global corporate spinoff deals closed this year through Dec. 1, already surpassing 130 for all of 2020 and 115 in 2019, according to data firm Refinitiv. Drugmaker Merck & Co., French media company Vivendi SE and freight-transportation company XPO Logistics Inc. in recent months completed such deals.

J&J's split won't necessarily be more complex or challenging than those of other companies, but questions remain about how issues such as litigation will be handled, said Damien Conover, director of healthcare research at research firm Morningstar Inc.

For example, it is unclear which business would handle future litigation relating to when the companies were one, he said. A spokeswoman for J&J declined to comment. The company in October placed into bankruptcy its liabilities for thousands of lawsuits tying talc-based products to cancer.

""It's pretty likely that litigation stays with the separate companies and the cash flows are strong enough to support that, but still, there's a bit of uncertainty,"" Mr. Conover said.

Each Offer and Consent Solicitation for a series of Notes is separate and distinct and is not conditioned upon the consummation of the other Offer or Consent Solicitation or adoption of the Proposed Amendments in respect of the other series of Notes or obtaining the requisite Consent with respect to the other series of Notes or the completion of the Offer for the other series of Notes.

The Offers and the Consent Solicitations are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated December 6, 2021 (the ""Offer to Purchase""), including the issuance and sale of debt securities by Newmont on terms satisfactory to the Company that will generate net proceeds in an amount that is sufficient to finance the purchase of the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase on or prior to the Early Settlement Date (as defined below).

The Offers and Consent Solicitations will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on January 4, 2022, unless extended by the Company in its sole discretion (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the ""Expiration Time"") or earlier terminated. In order to be eligible to receive the Total Consideration (as described below) for tendered Notes, holders must validly tender their Notes and deliver Consents at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 17, 2021 (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the ""Early Tender Deadline""), and not validly withdraw their tendered Notes or revoke the related Consents before such time.

The consideration (the ""Newmont Notes Total Consideration"") offered per $1,000 principal amount of Newmont Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Newmont Notes Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the fixed spread for the Newmont Notes specified above plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified above as quoted on the applicable page on the Bloomberg Bond Trader FIT4 series of pages at 10:00 a.m., New York City time on December 17, 2021.

The consideration (the ""Goldcorp Notes Total Consideration"" and, together with the Newmont Notes Total Consideration, the ""Total Consideration"") offered per $1,000 principal amount of Goldcorp Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Goldcorp Notes Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the fixed spread for the Goldcorp Notes specified above plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified above as quoted on the applicable page on the Bloomberg Bond Trader FIT4 series of pages at 10:00 a.m., New York City time on December 17, 2021.

Holders of any Notes that are validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration.

Holders of Newmont Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline but prior to the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the Newmont Notes Total Consideration minus an early tender payment of $50 (the ""Newmont Notes Early Tender Payment""). As used herein, the Newmont Notes Total Consideration minus the Newmont Notes Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Newmont Notes Tender Offer Consideration.""

Holders of Goldcorp Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline but prior to the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the Goldcorp Notes Total Consideration minus an early tender payment of $50 (the ""Goldcorp Notes Early Tender Payment""). As used herein, (i) the Goldcorp Notes Total Consideration minus the Goldcorp Notes Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Goldcorp Notes Tender Offer Consideration"" and (ii) the Newmont Notes Tender Offer Consideration and the Goldcorp Notes Tender Offer Consideration is referred to as the ""Tender Offer Consideration.""

In addition to the Total Consideration or the Tender Offer Consideration, as applicable, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date or promptly following the Expiration Time (the ""Final Settlement Date""), as applicable, payable on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date, as applicable.

The Early Tender Deadline is the last time for Holders to tender Notes in order to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration. Payment for the Notes that are validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and that are accepted for purchase will be made on the date referred to as the ""Early Settlement Date."" Newmont expects that the Early Settlement Date will be December 20, 2021 or as promptly as practicable thereafter.

Notes that are not tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will remain obligations of Newmont or Goldcorp, as applicable. There is no requirement in the Indentures or otherwise that Newmont or Goldcorp redeem any Notes, and unless redeemed, such Notes will continue to remain outstanding. Newmont and Goldcorp currently intend to send a notice of redemption to redeem any Notes outstanding after the Early Settlement Date.

This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption under the optional redemption provisions of the Indentures. Any notice of redemption of the Notes will be delivered pursuant to separate notices of redemption delivered in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture.

The complete terms and conditions of the Offers and Consent Solicitations are set forth in the Offer to Purchase that is being sent to holders of the Notes.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 06, 2021-- 

State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) , in collaboration with Vanguard and Symbiont, announced today that the firms have jointly completed the margin calculation process for a live trade of a 30-day foreign exchange forward contract through the use of Assembly, Symbiont's distributed ledger technology . The firms have been actively exploring the innovative application of blockchain technology to undertake margin processing for foreign-exchange forwards and swaps, with the goal of bringing post trade workflow automation and efficiencies while significantly reducing counterparty credit risk in the over-the-counter currency market.

Harnessing the benefits of blockchain technology within the largely manual currency forwards market will eventually enable the underlying contracts to also be instantiated, signed, executed and documented on a single unalterable record, digitally securing the trades and allowing for automation over their duration. Deploying these contracts on DLT facilitates more frequent and automated valuations, while also enabling parties in the network to move and settle collateral instantaneously -- significantly reducing counterparty risk and streamlining processes for those forwards that are non-cleared and subject to margining.

""State Street Digital is incredibly pleased to have collaborated with both Vanguard and Symbiont on this monumental industry initiative to digitize the margining process around collateralized foreign exchange forward contracts that will reduce our customers operational challenges through process automation and state of the art technologies,"" said Nadine Chakar , head of State Street Digital. ""Our newly launched division, State Street Digital, was created to help drive innovation and address the industry's digital transformation. We appreciate the joint collaboration on this project and look forward to future partnerships and further developing our digital capabilities for the crypto and digital assets environment.""

""Vanguard is committed to improving outcomes for all investors, whether through lowering the cost of investing or reinvesting in new services and innovative capabilities,"" said Warren Pennington, head of Vanguard's Investment Management FinTech Strategies Group. ""We're excited to partner with State Street and Symbiont on the world's first ever digital collateral-linked currency forward trade margining process. Leveraging cutting-edge distributed ledger technology represents a giant leap forward in foreign exchange market structure by reducing counterparty risk, automating previously manual processes, and mitigating potential disputes through standardized calculation processes. The lower risk and increased speed will lead to lower costs and improved outcomes for investors.""

""Today's announcement marks a transformative time for financial services and signals the evolution of blockchain as the ideal technology solution for foreign exchange contracts. Our market still manages risk on an overnight basis and lacks an efficient, real-time common infrastructure for valuing trades, calculating margin calls, and moving assets between counterparties as defined by the legal agreements (ISDA/CSA). That hampers the credit both firms are willing to extend to each other and the resulting dealing price. Our solution solves for that by allowing both counterparties to transact and participate in greater size (full amount) and activity based purely on best execution, without fear of increased credit exposure,"" commented, Mark Smith, CEO, Symbiont.

The mill will have an annual capacity of 430,000 tons and cost about $350M to construct, Nucor says. The steelmaker already operates similar regional micro-mills in Florida and Missouri. Rebar is used primarily with concrete in the construction of roads, buildings and sidewalks.

0944 ET - Knight-Swift Transportation buys Midwest Motor Express for $150M, the latest step in the big trucker's push to diversify its business lines and build out a nationwide less-than-truckload network. Knight-Swift bought regional LTL operator AAA Cooper Transportation in July, giving the largest US truckload carrier an LTL foothold in the Southeast and Midwest. Buying MME adds coverage in the upper Midwest and Northwest. LTL operations tend to offer steadier pricing and returns than truckload business, though the barriers to entry are higher. Knight-Swift says its percentage of non-truckload revenue will rise to 38% in 2021, up from 20% in 2019. Knight-Swift shares rise 3.7%. (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

0926 ET - Jack in the Box and Del Taco Restaurants are both based in California, but the companies believe uniting will help them expand nationally, executives say in an investor presentation announcing their merger. The combined chains span 25 states, with room to grow, Jack in the Box executives say. Fast-food Mexican rival Taco Bell , owned by Yum Brands , is located in all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

0905 ET - Jack in the Box Inc . says that it was attracted to Del Taco Restaurants' numerous drive-throughs in deciding to acquire the Mexican chain for $575M. Ninety-nine percent of the taco chain's 600 locations have drive-throughs, a key way of selling food during the pandemic. Jack in the Box previously owned another Mexican fast-food chain, Qdoba. The company sold it in 2017 after an activist stockholder pushed the issue, and Jack in the Box said it would focus on its core brand. Jack in the Box executives said on an investor call Monday that Del Taco's drive-throughs represent a key difference from Qdoba. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

0859 ET - Heavy-duty truck orders are tumbling as supply-chain snarls hit manufacturers. Preliminary net orders for Class-8 trucks in North America fell to 9,500 units in November, says FTR, down 41% from October and 82% from November 2020. Demand remains strong, but FTR says truck makers ""remain very reluctant"" to add to lengthy backlogs because of uncertainty in supply chains. Parts deliveries have been uneven, and shortages in components including semiconductors have kept factories from finishing off new big rigs. Manufacturers will hold back on new orders ""until the supply chain situation improves,"" says FTR's Don Ake. (paul.page@wsj.com)

0826 ET - A new study suggests potential for Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine as a ""mix-and-match"" booster shot. The J&J vaccine, when given six months after people received the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine, boosted levels of immune-system antibodies and T-cells in a study at Beth Israel in Boston. The increase in antibodies from the J&J shot was comparable to what a Pfizer booster shot achieved, while it surpassed the Pfizer shot in T-cell responses. It could be a tough sell, however, to convince Pfizer -vaccinated people to get the J&J booster: so far, about 95% of people receiving Pfizer 's vaccine have stuck with the same shot if they got a booster in the US, according to the CDC. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

0749 ET - A change in Vivendi 's stance regarding a spinoff of Telecom Italia 's network could be a way of forcing a higher offer for the telecommunications company, Bryan Garnier analyst Thomas Coudry says, referring to media reports that the French media conglomerate is open to talks on TIM with the Italian government. Vivendi , TIM's largest shareholder, previously said it felt a EUR10.8 billion all-share offer from investment company KKR undervalued TIM. According to the reports, Vivendi would now not oppose a spinoff of TIM's infrastructure network, and could even become a minority shareholder in the new business. Nevertheless, TIM losing control of its network would be detrimental to the industry, Coudry says. Neither Vivendi nor TIM responded to requests for comment. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0417 ET - Saint-Gobain 's agreement to acquire U.S.-based GCP Applied Technologies for a price of $32 a share should be well-received by investors, Bryan Garnier's Eric Lemarie says. The deal ""strengthens the exposure of Saint-Gobain to construction chemical, which is usually considered as an attractive business combining growth and profitability (although we observe GCP is less performant in chemical construction than Chryso),"" the analyst says. The French construction-materials company agreed to acquire Chryso earlier this year. Overall, multiples of the GCP deal suggest it might not be cheap but it also seems compensated by synergies, Lemarie says. Shares in Saint-Gobain trade 1.2% higher at EUR58.54.

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
TORONTO (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 6, 2021--S&P Global Ratings today said it 
assigned its 'BBB' issue-level rating to Newmont Corp .'s proposed senior 
unsecured notes issuance. The proposed notes are due in 2032 and subject to an 
incremental interest rate (accrued annually and due at maturity) if 
sustainability performance targets are not met. The notes will rank pari passu 
with the company's existing senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from the issuance 
will be used primarily to repay the company's 2022 and 2023 notes outstanding, 
with effectively no impact on leverage. Newmont's earliest material debt 
maturity will be 2029 on completion. 
 
The 'BBB' issuer credit rating and positive outlook on Newmont are unchanged. 
We estimate the company will generate strong credit measures over the next two 
years, including an average adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the low-1x area 
over the next two years. Our forecasts incorporate a gold price assumption of 
US$1,600 per ounce (/oz) in 2022 and US$1,400/oz in 2023. We have modestly 
tempered our earnings and cash flow expectations over the next few years 
following the company's recent update to operating guidance. We now expect 
modestly lower average gold output and higher average unit costs, but for the 
trend to improve beyond 2022. 
 
(For more information on Newmont, see our full analysis, published Oct. 21, 
2021, on RatingsDirect.)

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 6, 2021--S&P Global Ratings said today that 
American Water Works Co. Inc . (American Water) scored an 87 in its 
=50111392&isPDA=Y"". On our scale, 100 indicates the lowest risk, and 0 is the 
highest. The company's ESG Evaluation score is the result of an ESG profile 
score of 72, combined with best-in-class preparedness. 
 
American Water is a publicly traded utility holding company that provides, 
through its subsidiaries, water and wastewater utility services to about 15 
million people in about 1,600 communities across 16 U.S. states. Based in 
Camden, N.J., American Water is the largest investor-owned water utility 
company in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world, as measured by 
operating revenues and population served. 
 
American Water's ESG Evaluation score of 87 reflects our view that the company 
prioritizes commitments to safety, environmental stewardship, and public 
health in its strategy, and that ESG goals are a natural fit for and align 
well with its business model. Examples include the company's commitment to 
provide safe drinking water to its customers and safe workplace conditions to 
its employees. American Water also has a demonstrated commitment to diversity 
and inclusion. Furthermore, the company's governance benefits from strong 
structure and oversight, as demonstrated through its board structure and 
remuneration policies. 
 
Additionally, we view American Water's preparedness assessment of best in 
class as reflective of its ability to identify, assess, and act on risks and 
opportunities its business faces, such as climate change, infrastructure 
replacement, water contamination, and an aging workforce. The company fosters 
an effective culture to contend with sustainability-related risks, and it 
prioritizes safety and compliance with mandated regulations across all lines 
of operations to protect and enhance its financial and reputational standing. 
 
What Is An ESG Evaluation? 
S&P Global Ratings' ESG evaluation is a cross-sector, relative analysis of an 
entity's capacity to continue to operate successfully. It is grounded in how 
ESG factors could affect stakeholders, potentially leading to a material 
direct or indirect financial impact on the entity. 
 
Our definition of stakeholders for a particular entity goes beyond 
shareholders to include employees, the local community, government, 
regulators, customers, lenders, borrowers, policyholders, voters, members, and 
suppliers. A high ESG evaluation indicates an entity is relatively less prone 
to experiencing material ESG-related events, and is relatively better 
positioned to capitalize on ESG-related growth opportunities than entities 
with lower ESG evaluations. 
 
First, we establish an ESG profile for a given entity, which assesses the 
exposure of the entity's operations to observable ESG risks and opportunities, 
and how the entity is mitigating these risks and capitalizing on these 
opportunities. 
 
Second, we assess the entity's long-term preparedness, namely its capacity to 
anticipate and adapt to a variety of long-term plausible disruptions. 
 
S&P Global Ratings currently evaluates more than 85 entities across the globe; 
they have an average score of 68. Since the first ESG evaluation, published in 
June 2019, we have finalized ESG Evaluations across 21 sectors globally. By 
region, the highest average score is 73, for companies headquartered in 
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

The three distribution tiers include its annualized ordinary dividend, estimated at about $2.4B, expected buybacks of about $3.5B and a variable return of cash of about $1B. ""The basis of our capital returns approach is [cash from operations-driven], and our new three-tier framework can more easily flex distributions with commodity prices, while retaining some discretion in allocation across the tiers,"" says CEO Ryan Lance . Truist Securities says Conoco delivered a solid 2022 financial and operational plan. ""We believe the new framework gives most investors what they have been asking for by delivering minimal production growth, a solid base dividend, strong share repurchases, and opportunistic variable dividends,"" Truist says.

1134 ET - Ford is delaying its return-to-office plans by a few months, until March. The company said previously it planned to have office workers return to a hybrid working model in January. Now, it will have some employees return in a pilot phase in February, with remaining office workers returning in March under a flexible schedule, the company says. (mike.colias@wsj.com; @MikeColias)

1122 ET - Pinterest says it has acquired video-creation and editing app Vochi to help creators bring higher-quality content to its image-sharing platform. Vochi, founded in 2019, offers tools for adding special effects to videos. Pinterest says it will continue to be available as a standalone app for now. Finding new ways to boost engagement is important for Pinterest since it shed 24M users in 2Q on a sequential basis and another 10M in the third. In its recent shareholder letter, Pinterest indicated that as of Nov. 2, monthly users were flat in the US and up slightly on a global level from where they ended in 3Q. Financial terms of the Vochi deal weren't disclosed. Pinterest gains 2.4% to $36.75. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1104 ET - The CEO of Halliburton says underinvestment in oil and gas over the past seven years is setting up a new era of scarcity in global energy markets. International oil spending in recent years has been roughly 50% below historical norms, Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller says at the World Petroleum Congress in Houston. ""For the first time in a long time, you're seeing a buyer looking for a barrel of oil as opposed to a barrel of oil looking for a buyer,"" Miller says. (collin.eaton@wsj.com; @collineatonHC)

1048 ET - Natural gas stands to get a boost from electric vehicles over the next several years as EVs become more mainstream, Cowen predicts in a research publication. The investment bank sees ""substantial growth opportunity for natural gas driven by continuing EV penetration, with natural gas potentially seeing a cumulative demand increase of 50x between 2020 and 2040 to reach just over 50 billion cubic feet per day."" Cowen also believes transportation will get electric sooner than expected. ""We continue to maintain above-consensus estimates for electric vehicle (EV) penetration at 16% in 2025 vs. market expectations of 13%."" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1041 ET - Exxon Mobil says it will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. The Permian, in West Texas and New Mexico, is a key shale asset for Exxon where it plans to ramp up activity. CEO Darren Woods said at the World Petroleum Congress Monday that Exxon 's investments in electrifying its Permian operations coupled with reductions in methane leaks and flaring of natural gas give Exxon an ""achievable path"" to meet the goal.

1031 ET - Cowen has moved its projections for growth in the cannabis market higher, with the firm increasing its target for total market for cannabis by 2026 to $84B, up from its previous projection of $73B and well up from its initial projection of $50B. The main factor that has kept the cannabis market down is US legislation legalizing cannabis on the federal level, Cowen says. ""We continue to view Washington's legalization of cannabis as a matter of when, not if, and it is conceivable this could happen in 2022, either as a result of bipartisan legislation ahead of the November midterm elections, or potentially in the lame duck period that will begin in November 2022 and end in January 2023,"" says the firm in its latest report.

1009 ET - Brazil's Azul is using its own flight crew to deliver packages to customers, part of efforts to solve the ""last mile"" challenge that have helped its air cargo revenue double from 2019 to 2021. Azul executives, at an investor event, say it's taking share from trucks, mostly from flying cargo in planes' bellies, but also kitting out E1 jetliners with additional fire protection equipment in the cabins that obviate the need for cabin crew to accompany the freight.

1007 ET - Trucker Old Dominion Freight Line reports strong mid-quarter revenue growth on robust freight demand that the carrier says should continue into next year. The LTL operator says revenue per day rose 29.9% YOY in November, reflecting gains in market share and ongoing strength in the domestic economy. The key pricing metric of LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.4% excluding fuel surcharges for the quarter to date from the same period in 2020. CEO Greg Gantt says Old Dominion expects the sequential change in revenue per day for 4Q21 ""will once again exceed our 10-year average for this metric."" (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

0958 ET - Citi projects self-driving truck startup Embark Trucks showing profits by 2024, initiating coverage with a buy rating and $11 share-price target. Citi sees ""compelling"" economics for Embark following its move to public trading through a SPAC merger. The company's autonomous tech can be spread to multiple truck makers, which City says ""provides flexibility and reduces risk.""

0949 ET - Nucor says it will build a small mill to supply steel reinforcing bar to the south Atlantic region. The mill will have an annual capacity of 430,000 tons and cost about $350M to construct, Nucor says. The steelmaker already operates similar regional micro-mills in Florida and Missouri. Rebar is used primarily with concrete in the construction of roads, buildings and sidewalks. ""The East Coast market will be in need of additional rebar supply in the coming years, particularly with the recent passage of the infrastructure spending bill,"" CEO Leon Topalian says.

Subject to customary conditions, the offering is expected to close on December 20, 2021. The offering is being made pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission .

The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to the Company's future subordinated debt. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company's subsidiary Newmont USA Limited .

Newmont will be first in the mining industry to issue a sustainability-linked bond, representing a further step in aligning its financing strategy with environmental, social and governance commitments. The coupon of the Notes will be linked to Newmont's performance against the 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles targets. Earlier this year, Newmont entered into a $3.0 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, one of the first in the industry.

The interest rate payable on the Notes will be increased if the Company fails to reach the stated targets by 2030. Newmont published a Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework and obtained a second party opinion on the framework from ISS ESG.

The Company estimates that the net proceeds to us from the offering will be approximately $992 million, after deducting estimated discounts (before expenses). The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering, the repurchase of (i) the Company's outstanding 3.700% Notes due 2023, and (ii) outstanding 3.700% Notes due 2023 issued by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Goldcorp Inc ., for up to certain aggregate maximum principal tender amounts specified in a related offer to purchase, which are accepted for purchase and any remaining portion for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company has also issued a notice of redemption for its outstanding 3.500% Notes due 2022. The notice calls for the redemption of all of the Company's outstanding 2022 Notes on December 15, 2021.

BMO Capital Markets Corp ., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC , Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will act as joint book-running managers for the offering and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC will also act as sustainability-linked bond structuring advisor for the offering.

The mill will have an annual capacity of 430,000 tons and cost about $350M to construct, Nucor says. The steelmaker already operates similar regional micro-mills in Florida and Missouri. Rebar is used primarily with concrete in the construction of roads, buildings and sidewalks. ""The East Coast market will be in need of additional rebar supply in the coming years, particularly with the recent passage of the infrastructure spending bill,"" CEO Leon Topalian says.

0710 ET - Victrex may take time to make progress despite an upbeat second half, Citigroup says. The plastics group's 2H results topped expectations, helped by modestly improving higher-margin medical sales, the investment bank says. ""Looking forward to 2022, management expects growth in volumes, offset by raw materials and energy cost impacts as well as foreign-exchange headwinds,"" Citi analysts say. ""VCT is exiting the trough but the process should take time, constraining the upside for the shares, in our opinion."" (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0510 ET - The price of uranium is up 60% over the past year, but it could increase further if political momentum behind nuclear power continues to gather, AJ Bell says. China plans to build 150 new nuclear plants, France intends to restart its nuclear power program, Japan's new prime minister favors restarting at least 30 nuclear sites, and the U.K. has begun to champion Rolls-Royce's modular nuclear reactors, AJ Bell recaps. Yellow Cake is a London-listed company which buys and holds uranium. ""If uranium prices keep rising, then so will the value of Yellow Cake's 17.9 million pounds of uranium (and it has an option to buy another one million pounds by next June),"" AJ Bell says.

0506 ET - Petropavlovsk has completed the sale of its 31.1% shareholding in iron-ore group IRC, lifting a material source of downside risk to its shares, Peel Hunt says. This is because the disposal releases Petropavlovsk from a loan guarantee, which is likely to mean that the gold miner now has many more refinancing options at more competitive rates. While the sale was at a low price, it will allow the company to focus purely on its gold assets and strategy, Peel Hunt says. ""We believe the group now needs to see a period of quiet delivery to reassure investors, rather than a repeat of the recent headlines of UGC taking the company to court,"" the brokerage says. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

0451 ET - Ferrexpo's 2022 Ebitda could be enhanced by around $35 million as iron ore pellet prices are forecast to be higher than previously anticipated, Peel Hunt says. Media reports suggest that Vale has settled the first quarter pellet premium at $55 a ton, well above the $40 expected by Peel Hunt . As a result, and given Ferrexpo's strong free cash flow generation and net cash position, its strong dividend payout record is likely to continue next year, the brokerage says. However, the deployment of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border is likely to lead investors to watch and wait, Peel Hunt says. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

0450 ET - Shares in Thungela Resources jumped 15% after it reported a better-than-expected cash position and guided that the dividend will be resumed in 2021. The South African coal miner, which was demerged from Anglo American this year, had a cash position of around ZAR8 billion as of Nov. 30, which suggests a stronger-than-expected balance sheet, Citi says. This beat was likely driven by lower-than-expected discounts to benchmark coal prices, Citi believes. In addition, the U.S. bank forecasts that Thungela will pay a dividend of ZAR4.0 a share for 2021. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

1808 ET - The mining sector is heading into a part of the commodities cycle that's historically been very constructive for small- and medium-sized companies, says Janus Henderson's natural resources head Daniel Sullivan. Those companies are typically free of the constraints that keep big miners from investing and can develop interesting deposits needed to feed market demand, he says. ""Successful exploration and project de-risking is typically highly value accretive and rewarding to shareholders,"" says Sullivan. He also reckons there's already some cheap precious-metals miners that need to be revalued, with stocks ""in better health than we can ever recall"" supported by a gold-positive inflationary environment. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

1800 ET - It's easy to see why some investors are downbeat on mining stocks, which tend to perform best when commodity prices are rising, says Janus Henderson's natural resources head Daniel Sullivan, noting the sharp fall in iron-ore prices in recent months. Nonetheless, ""we are now moving to a part of the cycle where free cash flow improves"" and ""the positive tight-supply, strong-demand story for commodities is most likely to roll on into 2022 and prove supportive of energy and metals markets,"" Sullivan says. He highlights how miners continue to hold back on big projects and deals, which should support investor returns--and stock prices--as free cash flow from the mining sector builds, he says. Sullivan also reckons the longer run outlook is ""incredibly exciting"" given the role that natural resources companies have to play in a shift to a low carbon economy.

0859 ET - Heavy-duty truck orders are tumbling as supply-chain snarls hit manufacturers. Preliminary net orders for Class-8 trucks in North America fell to 9,500 units in November, says FTR, down 41% from October and 82% from November 2020. Demand remains strong, but FTR says truck makers ""remain very reluctant"" to add to lengthy backlogs because of uncertainty in supply chains. Parts deliveries have been uneven, and shortages in components including semiconductors have kept factories from finishing off new big rigs. Manufacturers will hold back on new orders ""until the supply chain situation improves,"" says FTR's Don Ake. (paul.page@wsj.com)

0826 ET - A new study suggests potential for Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine as a ""mix-and-match"" booster shot. The J&J vaccine, when given six months after people received the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine, boosted levels of immune-system antibodies and T-cells in a study at Beth Israel in Boston. The increase in antibodies from the J&J shot was comparable to what a Pfizer booster shot achieved, while it surpassed the Pfizer shot in T-cell responses. It could be a tough sell, however, to convince Pfizer -vaccinated people to get the J&J booster: so far, about 95% of people receiving Pfizer 's vaccine have stuck with the same shot if they got a booster in the US, according to the CDC.

0749 ET - A change in Vivendi 's stance regarding a spinoff of Telecom Italia 's network could be a way of forcing a higher offer for the telecommunications company, Bryan Garnier analyst Thomas Coudry says, referring to media reports that the French media conglomerate is open to talks on TIM with the Italian government. Vivendi , TIM's largest shareholder, previously said it felt a EUR10.8 billion all-share offer from investment company KKR undervalued TIM. According to the reports, Vivendi would now not oppose a spinoff of TIM's infrastructure network, and could even become a minority shareholder in the new business. Nevertheless, TIM losing control of its network would be detrimental to the industry, Coudry says. Neither Vivendi nor TIM responded to requests for comment. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0417 ET - Saint-Gobain 's agreement to acquire U.S.-based GCP Applied Technologies for a price of $32 a share should be well-received by investors, Bryan Garnier's Eric Lemarie says. The deal ""strengthens the exposure of Saint-Gobain to construction chemical, which is usually considered as an attractive business combining growth and profitability (although we observe GCP is less performant in chemical construction than Chryso),"" the analyst says. The French construction-materials company agreed to acquire Chryso earlier this year. Overall, multiples of the GCP deal suggest it might not be cheap but it also seems compensated by synergies, Lemarie says. Shares in Saint-Gobain trade 1.2% higher at EUR58.54.

Some 30% of new luxury customers enter the market via everyday products like sneakers, BG says, citing a recent report from Bain and Italian luxury association Altagamma. While the sneaker category represents a small fraction of overall luxury-footwear sales, it drove segment growth this year, thanks in part to a casualization trend, BG notes. Growth in luxury's lower price ranges is meanwhile drawing exclusive brands like Chanel and LVMH 's Dior into the sneaker business, the investment bank adds. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0949 ET - Nucor says it will build a small mill to supply steel reinforcing bar to the south Atlantic region. The mill will have an annual capacity of 430,000 tons and cost about $350M to construct, Nucor says. The steelmaker already operates similar regional micro-mills in Florida and Missouri. Rebar is used primarily with concrete in the construction of roads, buildings and sidewalks. ""The East Coast market will be in need of additional rebar supply in the coming years, particularly with the recent passage of the infrastructure spending bill,"" CEO Leon Topalian says.

0944 ET - Knight-Swift Transportation buys Midwest Motor Express for $150M, the latest step in the big trucker's push to diversify its business lines and build out a nationwide less-than-truckload network. Knight-Swift bought regional LTL operator AAA Cooper Transportation in July, giving the largest US truckload carrier an LTL foothold in the Southeast and Midwest. Buying MME adds coverage in the upper Midwest and Northwest. LTL operations tend to offer steadier pricing and returns than truckload business, though the barriers to entry are higher. Knight-Swift says its percentage of non-truckload revenue will rise to 38% in 2021, up from 20% in 2019. Knight-Swift shares rise 3.7%. (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

0933 ET - Mexican production of cars and light trucks fell 20% in November from the year-earlier month to 249K units, and was off 0.7% in the January-November period at just under 2.8M, statistics institute Inegi reports. ""The downward trend recorded by auto production during the year is related to the shortage of inputs globally, which have also hampered the production of other manufactured goods, and which we believe should persist in the following months,"" says Citi. November auto exports fell 16% from a year before to 240K units, and domestic new-car sales were down 13% at 83K. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

0926 ET - Jack in the Box and Del Taco Restaurants are both based in California, but the companies believe uniting will help them expand nationally, executives say in an investor presentation announcing their merger.

(heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

0905 ET - Jack in the Box Inc . says that it was attracted to Del Taco Restaurants' numerous drive-throughs in deciding to acquire the Mexican chain for $575M. Ninety-nine percent of the taco chain's 600 locations have drive-throughs, a key way of selling food during the pandemic. Jack in the Box previously owned another Mexican fast-food chain, Qdoba. The company sold it in 2017 after an activist stockholder pushed the issue, and Jack in the Box said it would focus on its core brand. Jack in the Box executives said on an investor call Monday that Del Taco's drive-throughs represent a key difference from Qdoba. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

0859 ET - Heavy-duty truck orders are tumbling as supply-chain snarls hit manufacturers. Preliminary net orders for Class-8 trucks in North America fell to 9,500 units in November, says FTR, down 41% from October and 82% from November 2020. Demand remains strong, but FTR says truck makers ""remain very reluctant"" to add to lengthy backlogs because of uncertainty in supply chains. Parts deliveries have been uneven, and shortages in components including semiconductors have kept factories from finishing off new big rigs. Manufacturers will hold back on new orders ""until the supply chain situation improves,"" says FTR's Don Ake. (paul.page@wsj.com)

0856 ET - The emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant and restrictions are weighing on eurozone investor confidence, Pantheon Macroeconomics says. The eurozone Sentix investor sentiment index fell to 13.5 in December from 18.3 in November, its lowest level since April. The decline was driven by a drop in the current conditions gauge, Pantheon's senior Europe economist Melanie Debono says. The fall in the current situation index suggests that markets believe economic growth will slow sharply in the fourth quarter, as Pantheon forecasts. Pantheon expects eurozone GDP growth to slow to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in 4Q, from 3Q's 2.2%. With virus cases and hospitalizations rising, the downside risks to the economic outlook are mounting, Debono says. Pantheon forecasts the Sentix will fall again in January. (maria.martinez@wsj.com)

0847 ET - Julius Baer is attractively priced following a pullback in European banks' shares, UBS says, upgrading its recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral. The Swiss bank's shares are down 15% from recent highs, and the market's reaction to its last update was bearish, likely due to concerns around gross margin trends, UBS says. However, this doesn't change Julius Baer 's good fundamentals: it offers a cash-generative business model, capital build of up to 50 basis points a year--after payout of around 70%--and structural growth opportunities above GDP growth levels, UBS says. Plus, in the event of a market downturn, good cost management would protect its balance sheet, it says. UBS lifts its price target on the stock to CHF71 from CHF63. Shares trade 2.9% higher at CHF59.44. (cristina.roca@wsj.com; @_cristinaroca)

0826 ET - A new study suggests potential for Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine as a ""mix-and-match"" booster shot. The J&J vaccine, when given six months after people received the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine, boosted levels of immune-system antibodies and T-cells in a study at Beth Israel in Boston. The increase in antibodies from the J&J shot was comparable to what a Pfizer booster shot achieved, while it surpassed the Pfizer shot in T-cell responses. It could be a tough sell, however, to convince Pfizer -vaccinated people to get the J&J booster: so far, about 95% of people receiving Pfizer 's vaccine have stuck with the same shot if they got a booster in the US, according to the CDC.

0815 ET - Centrica is set to benefit from higher gas and power prices, even though the operational performance of its upstream business has been historically volatile, Jefferies says. The U.S. bank now expects upstream to account for 41% of the group's EPS in 2021-2025, up from its previous assumption of 29%. As for the energy retail division, the current supplier fallout will enable Centrica to grow its customer base to a 25% market share by 2023, which Jefferies sees as a long-term positive. However, on the flip side, customers are switching to capped-price contracts, which will squeeze margins. Overall, Jefferies upgrades 2021-2023 EPS forecasts by 14% and raises the Centrica target price to 72 pence from 58 pence. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

   -- NGM 's additional myeloid checkpoint inhibitor candidates include NGM831 
      and NGM438, ILT3 and LAIR1 antagonist antibodies 

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 06, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc . (NGM ) (Nasdaq: NGM), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients, today announced a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) to evaluate NGM707, NGM 's wholly-owned novel ILT2/ILT4 dual antagonist antibody, in combination with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA. NGM is currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1/2 trial, initiated in June 2021, to evaluate the potential of NGM707 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with elevated expression of ILT2 and ILT4.

""ILT2 and ILT4 are among a group of myeloid immune checkpoint receptors that are upregulated in patients who do not respond to T-cell checkpoint therapy, suggesting that they are potential resistance mechanisms that generate an immunosuppressive state in the tumor microenvironment. We're excited by the unique profile of NGM707 in the myeloid checkpoint inhibition space. Our preclinical studies suggest that NGM707's dual blockade of ILT2 and ILT4 may be more effective than blockade of either receptor alone in reversing myeloid based immune suppression, which is known to limit anti-tumor immunity,"" said Hsiao D. Lieu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at NGM Bio.

Dr. Lieu continued, ""We're pleased to enter into this agreement with Merck for our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of NGM707. In preclinical models, we have demonstrated that NGM707 in combination with KEYTRUDA acts additively to increase T cell activation and cytokine secretion. We look forward to evaluating how these mechanisms of action translate in the clinic to potentially enable broader and deeper anti-tumor immune responses, bringing the promise of immunotherapy to more cancer patients.""

ILT2 and ILT4, inhibitory receptors with enriched expression on myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, are myeloid checkpoints that may enable certain tumors to evade immune detection, thereby suppressing patients' anti-tumor response. NGM707 is being developed with the goal of improving patient immune response to tumors by inhibiting both ILT2 and ILT4. By inhibiting both ILT2 and ILT4, NGM707 may be able to overcome the potential redundant role the two receptors play when co-expressed in myeloid cells and reprogram those cells to enhance T cell activity and proliferation. In addition, ILT2 blockade may drive further benefit through reducing suppression in certain lymphoid cells capable of directly attacking tumor cells.

KEYTRUDA(R) is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp ., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

About the NGM707 Phase 1/2 Trial Design

The Phase 1 portion (n 60) of the trial includes a monotherapy dose escalation arm (Part 1a) and a dose-finding arm in combination with KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab) (Part 1b). The Phase 2 portion (n 120) of the trial will employ a basket design that will include expansion cohorts of patients treated with NGM707 monotherapy (Part 2a) or NGM707 in combination with KEYTRUDA (Part 2b) in a variety of selected solid tumor types.

Vivendi , TIM's largest shareholder, previously said it felt a EUR10.8 billion all-share offer from investment company KKR undervalued TIM. According to the reports, Vivendi would now not oppose a spinoff of TIM's infrastructure network, and could even become a minority shareholder in the new business. Nevertheless, TIM losing control of its network would be detrimental to the industry, Coudry says. Neither Vivendi nor TIM responded to requests for comment. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0417 ET - Saint-Gobain 's agreement to acquire U.S.-based GCP Applied Technologies for a price of $32 a share should be well-received by investors, Bryan Garnier's Eric Lemarie says. The deal ""strengthens the exposure of Saint-Gobain to construction chemical, which is usually considered as an attractive business combining growth and profitability (although we observe GCP is less performant in chemical construction than Chryso),"" the analyst says. The French construction-materials company agreed to acquire Chryso earlier this year. Overall, multiples of the GCP deal suggest it might not be cheap but it also seems compensated by synergies, Lemarie says. Shares in Saint-Gobain trade 1.2% higher at EUR58.54.

The increase in antibodies from the J&J shot was comparable to what a Pfizer booster shot achieved, while it surpassed the Pfizer shot in T-cell responses. It could be a tough sell, however, to convince Pfizer -vaccinated people to get the J&J booster: so far, about 95% of people receiving Pfizer 's vaccine have stuck with the same shot if they got a booster in the US, according to the CDC.

1147 ET - Meat giant Tyson Foods says it plans to pay out $50M in bonuses to its frontline and hourly employees starting this month, with eligible US workers receiving checks ranging from $300 to $700. A nationwide labor shortage has constrained production at Tyson and other meat companies in recent months. Employers are raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain their workers.

1139 ET - ConocoPhillips says it expects its $7B 2022 capital returns to shareholders, up 16%, will be allocated roughly equally between cash and share repurchases. The three distribution tiers include its annualized ordinary dividend, estimated at about $2.4B, expected buybacks of about $3.5B and a variable return of cash of about $1B. ""The basis of our capital returns approach is [cash from operations-driven], and our new three-tier framework can more easily flex distributions with commodity prices, while retaining some discretion in allocation across the tiers,"" says CEO Ryan Lance . Truist Securities says Conoco delivered a solid 2022 financial and operational plan.

Finding new ways to boost engagement is important for Pinterest since it shed 24M users in 2Q on a sequential basis and another 10M in the third. In its recent shareholder letter, Pinterest indicated that as of Nov. 2, monthly users were flat in the US and up slightly on a global level from where they ended in 3Q.

The main factor that has kept the cannabis market down is US legislation legalizing cannabis on the federal level, Cowen says. ""We continue to view Washington's legalization of cannabis as a matter of when, not if, and it is conceivable this could happen in 2022, either as a result of bipartisan legislation ahead of the November midterm elections, or potentially in the lame duck period that will begin in November 2022 and end in January 2023,"" says the firm in its latest report.

But as companies have been reintroducing ships back into the waters, they have had shorter timelines to sell near-term tickets. That has led to discounting to tempt people on board in the coming months, especially as variants have proliferated and breakthrough infections in vaccinated consumers occur.

A note out from Truist Securities last month showed discounted ticket pricing by Carnival Corp . and Royal Caribbean Group  for sailings in the first half of next year, citing conversations with senior executives at large travel agencies that specialize in cruises. Indeed, Carnival's website last week showed it offering 40% off cruise rates as part of a ""cyber week promotion,"" while Royal Caribbean 's webpage opened to an offer of ""30% off all guests,"" plus additional discounts.

Historically, once cruise lines have started discounting, it can take years to get back to prediscounted levels. As Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio  explained on a conference call last month, long periods of clawbacks have occurred ""time and time again."" He cautioned that some companies have still not recovered to pre-Great Recession yields more than a decade later. For that reason, he said Norwegian is ""fixated on pricing"" and would sacrifice short-term occupancy to preserve it.

Norwegian, which in contrast to Carnival and Royal Caribbean  is skewed more toward the luxury market, is offering a cyber sale right now, but it is focused on onboard discounting, rather than discounted ticket prices. According to its website last week, Norwegian has been offering up to $4,250 in value for onboard activities like a free open bar, specialty dining, excursions, Wi-Fi, airfare for a second guest and even $250 to spend on a Norwegian cruise.

Mike Driscoll, editor of industry newsletter Cruise Week, says discounting for the first quarter of next year has been mild from luxury lines, climbing somewhat with premium lines and is very high among more mass-market brands. On the whole, he notes heavy discounting for the first half of next year is occurring at levels ""not seen since 2009."" In an article in Travel Weekly last month, Norwegian's Mr. Del Rio was quoted as referring to the low prices of some cruises as ""shocking.""

However, Mr. Driscoll said the second half of next year is already seeing solid pricing, up 5% to 7% compared with 2019, citing various retail sources, though he notes luxury lines are showing the greatest strength. Wall Street is modeling overall passenger ticket revenue growing midsingle digit percentages versus 2019 levels by the end of next year for Carnival and Royal Caribbean , but shows Norwegian's passenger ticket revenue growing 14% on that basis.

In an interview for this column, UBS analyst Robin Farley cautioned against applying recovery timelines from historical downturns to today's situation. Hotels, she points out, have seen a much healthier recovery recently than from a usual downturn, noting prices are back ahead of occupancy in that sector.

Relative to hotels, cruise-ship supply is limited. A spokesperson for Carnival said that because there have been only a limited number of yards building cruise ships each year around the world, there is a natural cap on supply growth. That means that, while there might be some near-term discounting, demand should exceed supply longer-term, providing for an environment for pricing stability. Indeed, in the years before the pandemic, occupancy rates for Carnival and Royal Caribbean  consistently ran over 100%.

In his note last month, Truist's Patrick Scholes did say the past 20 months have been unlike anything the cruise industry has seen before, musing, ""perhaps this time will be different.""

Cruise operators are hoping so. But investors might need to see firmer evidence of a rapid pricing recovery before they dive in.

A nationwide labor shortage has constrained production at Tyson and other meat companies in recent months. Employers are raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain their workers.

1139 ET - ConocoPhillips says it expects its $7B 2022 capital returns to shareholders, up 16%, will be allocated roughly equally between cash and share repurchases. The three distribution tiers include its annualized ordinary dividend, estimated at about $2.4B, expected buybacks of about $3.5B and a variable return of cash of about $1B.

1104 ET - The CEO of Halliburton says underinvestment in oil and gas over the past seven years is setting up a new era of scarcity in global energy markets. International oil spending in recent years has been roughly 50% below historical norms, Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller says at the World Petroleum Congress in Houston. ""For the first time in a long time, you're seeing a buyer looking for a barrel of oil as opposed to a barrel of oil looking for a buyer,"" Miller says. (collin.eaton@wsj.com; @collineatonHC)

1048 ET - Natural gas stands to get a boost from electric vehicles over the next several years as EVs become more mainstream, Cowen predicts in a research publication. The investment bank sees ""substantial growth opportunity for natural gas driven by continuing EV penetration, with natural gas potentially seeing a cumulative demand increase of 50x between 2020 and 2040 to reach just over 50 billion cubic feet per day."" Cowen also believes transportation will get electric sooner than expected.

1041 ET - Exxon Mobil says it will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. The Permian, in West Texas and New Mexico, is a key shale asset for Exxon where it plans to ramp up activity. CEO Darren Woods said at the World Petroleum Congress Monday that Exxon 's investments in electrifying its Permian operations coupled with reductions in methane leaks and flaring of natural gas give Exxon an ""achievable path"" to meet the goal.

1031 ET - Cowen has moved its projections for growth in the cannabis market higher, with the firm increasing its target for total market for cannabis by 2026 to $84B, up from its previous projection of $73B and well up from its initial projection of $50B. The main factor that has kept the cannabis market down is US legislation legalizing cannabis on the federal level, Cowen says. ""We continue to view Washington's legalization of cannabis as a matter of when, not if, and it is conceivable this could happen in 2022, either as a result of bipartisan legislation ahead of the November midterm elections, or potentially in the lame duck period that will begin in November 2022 and end in January 2023,"" says the firm in its latest report.

1009 ET - Brazil's Azul is using its own flight crew to deliver packages to customers, part of efforts to solve the ""last mile"" challenge that have helped its air cargo revenue double from 2019 to 2021. Azul executives, at an investor event, say it's taking share from trucks, mostly from flying cargo in planes' bellies, but also kitting out E1 jetliners with additional fire protection equipment in the cabins that obviate the need for cabin crew to accompany the freight.

1007 ET - Trucker Old Dominion Freight Line reports strong mid-quarter revenue growth on robust freight demand that the carrier says should continue into next year. The LTL operator says revenue per day rose 29.9% YOY in November, reflecting gains in market share and ongoing strength in the domestic economy. The key pricing metric of LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.4% excluding fuel surcharges for the quarter to date from the same period in 2020. CEO Greg Gantt says Old Dominion expects the sequential change in revenue per day for 4Q21 ""will once again exceed our 10-year average for this metric."" (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

1120 ET - Persimmon's fiber-to-the-home ultra-fast broadband offering, FibreNest, is underestimated in the company's valuation, Jefferies says. The house builders' internet offering has a value of around GBP550 million--comfortably supported by recent fundraising from its rivals--and is worth around 6% of the company's market cap, the U.S. bank says. FibreNest should be a positive contributor to profits from fiscal 2022 and the annual revenue it offers from subscriptions brings additional earnings potential, Jefferies says, retaining its buy rating and 3,706 pence price target for Persimmon stock. Shares are down 1.4% at 2,767.0 pence. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

1113 ET - Babcock International shares are not as attractive as those of rivals, says Numis Securities ahead of the defense and business-service contractor's first-half results on Tuesday. Numis expects the group's underlying performance to have shown little improvement from fiscal 2021, with ingrained cost inefficiencies and the continuing impact from Covid-19 on flying hours likely to have affected its aviation operation in particular. ""We're also interested to see if early progress has been made in reducing the material gap between average and period-end net debt,"" Numis analyst James Beard says. ""Although the shares have underperformed recently to move below our price target...we continue to view other outsourcing names (e.g. Mitie and Serco ) as more attractive."" (philip.waller@wsj.com)

1104 ET - The CEO of Halliburton says underinvestment in oil and gas over the past seven years is setting up a new era of scarcity in global energy markets. International oil spending in recent years has been roughly 50% below historical norms, Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller says at the World Petroleum Congress in Houston. ""For the first time in a long time, you're seeing a buyer looking for a barrel of oil as opposed to a barrel of oil looking for a buyer,"" Miller says. (collin.eaton@wsj.com; @collineatonHC)

1101 ET - Brazil's Azul says the Omicron variant hasn't hit bookings through to carnival in February, which continue at record levels in the world's fifth largest airline market by capacity. Brazil has one of the highest vaccination rates, recently around 64%. CEO John Rodgerson says at an investor event that, given the sharp fall in oil prices triggered by the variant's emergence, maybe it's the best thing that's happened to the industry.

1058 ET - UniCredit 's long-term profitability should benefit from interest-rate increases and higher capital returns, JPMorgan says. Markets have already priced in an interest-rate hike by the ECB at the end of 2022 or early 2023, but underestimate the pace of subsequent increases, JPM says, forecasting a 25 basis-point rise in September 2023 and a 50 basis-point increase in 2024. UniCredit is one of the banks most geared to rate hikes, JPM says, upgrading its recommendation on the Italian lender's shares to overweight from neutral. ""We also expect the outlook for capital return to improve in the next three years,"" JPM says, calculating payout could increase to about 75% for 2022-24. JPM says its EUR15 target price for UniCredit shares implies 36% upside. UniCredit trades 2% higher at EUR11.36. (cristina.roca@wsj.com; @_cristinaroca)

1048 ET - Natural gas stands to get a boost from electric vehicles over the next several years as EVs become more mainstream, Cowen predicts in a research publication. The investment bank sees ""substantial growth opportunity for natural gas driven by continuing EV penetration, with natural gas potentially seeing a cumulative demand increase of 50x between 2020 and 2040 to reach just over 50 billion cubic feet per day."" Cowen also believes transportation will get electric sooner than expected. ""We continue to maintain above-consensus estimates for electric vehicle (EV) penetration at 16% in 2025 vs. market expectations of 13%."" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1041 ET - Exxon Mobil says it will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. The Permian, in West Texas and New Mexico, is a key shale asset for Exxon where it plans to ramp up activity. CEO Darren Woods said at the World Petroleum Congress Monday that Exxon 's investments in electrifying its Permian operations coupled with reductions in methane leaks and flaring of natural gas give Exxon an ""achievable path"" to meet the goal.

The mill will have an annual capacity of 430,000 tons and cost about $350M to construct, Nucor says. The steelmaker already operates similar regional micro-mills in Florida and Missouri. Rebar is used primarily with concrete in the construction of roads, buildings and sidewalks. ""The East Coast market will be in need of additional rebar supply in the coming years, particularly with the recent passage of the infrastructure spending bill,"" CEO Leon Topalian says.

0710 ET - Victrex may take time to make progress despite an upbeat second half, Citigroup says. The plastics group's 2H results topped expectations, helped by modestly improving higher-margin medical sales, the investment bank says. ""Looking forward to 2022, management expects growth in volumes, offset by raw materials and energy cost impacts as well as foreign-exchange headwinds,"" Citi analysts say.

0510 ET - The price of uranium is up 60% over the past year, but it could increase further if political momentum behind nuclear power continues to gather, AJ Bell says. China plans to build 150 new nuclear plants, France intends to restart its nuclear power program, Japan's new prime minister favors restarting at least 30 nuclear sites, and the U.K. has begun to champion Rolls-Royce's modular nuclear reactors, AJ Bell recaps. Yellow Cake is a London-listed company which buys and holds uranium. ""If uranium prices keep rising, then so will the value of Yellow Cake's 17.9 million pounds of uranium (and it has an option to buy another one million pounds by next June),"" AJ Bell says.

0506 ET - Petropavlovsk has completed the sale of its 31.1% shareholding in iron-ore group IRC, lifting a material source of downside risk to its shares, Peel Hunt says. This is because the disposal releases Petropavlovsk from a loan guarantee, which is likely to mean that the gold miner now has many more refinancing options at more competitive rates. While the sale was at a low price, it will allow the company to focus purely on its gold assets and strategy, Peel Hunt says. ""We believe the group now needs to see a period of quiet delivery to reassure investors, rather than a repeat of the recent headlines of UGC taking the company to court,"" the brokerage says. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

0451 ET - Ferrexpo's 2022 Ebitda could be enhanced by around $35 million as iron ore pellet prices are forecast to be higher than previously anticipated, Peel Hunt says. Media reports suggest that Vale has settled the first quarter pellet premium at $55 a ton, well above the $40 expected by Peel Hunt . As a result, and given Ferrexpo's strong free cash flow generation and net cash position, its strong dividend payout record is likely to continue next year, the brokerage says. However, the deployment of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border is likely to lead investors to watch and wait, Peel Hunt says. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

0450 ET - Shares in Thungela Resources jumped 15% after it reported a better-than-expected cash position and guided that the dividend will be resumed in 2021. The South African coal miner, which was demerged from Anglo American this year, had a cash position of around ZAR8 billion as of Nov. 30, which suggests a stronger-than-expected balance sheet, Citi says. This beat was likely driven by lower-than-expected discounts to benchmark coal prices, Citi believes. In addition, the U.S. bank forecasts that Thungela will pay a dividend of ZAR4.0 a share for 2021. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

1808 ET - The mining sector is heading into a part of the commodities cycle that's historically been very constructive for small- and medium-sized companies, says Janus Henderson's natural resources head Daniel Sullivan. Those companies are typically free of the constraints that keep big miners from investing and can develop interesting deposits needed to feed market demand, he says. ""Successful exploration and project de-risking is typically highly value accretive and rewarding to shareholders,"" says Sullivan. He also reckons there's already some cheap precious-metals miners that need to be revalued, with stocks ""in better health than we can ever recall"" supported by a gold-positive inflationary environment. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

1800 ET - It's easy to see why some investors are downbeat on mining stocks, which tend to perform best when commodity prices are rising, says Janus Henderson's natural resources head Daniel Sullivan, noting the sharp fall in iron-ore prices in recent months. Nonetheless, ""we are now moving to a part of the cycle where free cash flow improves"" and ""the positive tight-supply, strong-demand story for commodities is most likely to roll on into 2022 and prove supportive of energy and metals markets,"" Sullivan says. He highlights how miners continue to hold back on big projects and deals, which should support investor returns--and stock prices--as free cash flow from the mining sector builds, he says. Sullivan also reckons the longer run outlook is ""incredibly exciting"" given the role that natural resources companies have to play in a shift to a low carbon economy.

In preclinical models, nirogacestat has been shown to increase the cell surface density of BCMA and reduce levels of soluble BCMA, thereby enhancing the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies, including CD3 bispecific antibodies.(1,2)

""We are very pleased to be dosing patients in this study, which is one of six collaborations evaluating the combination of nirogacestat with a BCMA-targeted therapy as part of our broader effort to explore our gamma secretase inhibitor's role as a potential cornerstone of BCMA combination therapy,"" said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks. ""Our goal is to improve treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma and we look forward to generating data with our collaborators to determine if adding nirogacestat can potentiate the activity of BCMA-directed therapies for these patients.""

The Phase 1b/2 trial, which is one sub-study of Pfizer 's umbrella MagnetisMM-4 trial (NCT05090566), is an open-label study evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of elranatamab in combination with nirogacestat in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The trial is being advanced pursuant to a clinical trial collaboration agreement between SpringWorks and Pfizer . Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer is sponsoring and conducting the Phase 1b/2 study and is assuming all costs other than expenses related to the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. The companies have formed a joint development committee to manage the clinical study.

About Elranatamab

Elranatamab is an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3-targeted bispecific antibody being investigated in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Binding affinity to BCMA and CD3 has been optimized, to potentially elicit more potent T-cell-mediated anti-myeloma activity. Elranatamab is being investigated as a subcutaneous administration, which is intended to allow higher doses than intravenous administration without increasing adverse events.

Elranatamab has been granted Orphan Drug Designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The U.S. FDA and EMA have also granted elranatamab Fast Track Designation for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory drug, and one anti-CD38 antibody and the PRIME scheme for the treatment of multiple myeloma, respectively.

About Nirogacestat

Nirogacestat is an investigational, oral, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development for desmoid tumors, which are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft-tissue tumors. Gamma secretase cleaves multiple transmembrane protein complexes, including Notch, which is believed to play a role in activating pathways that contribute to desmoid tumor growth.

In addition, gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors for BCMA-directed therapies. Nirogacestat's ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in preclinical models of multiple myeloma. SpringWorks is evaluating nirogacestat as a BCMA potentiator and has six collaborations with industry-leading BCMA developers to evaluate nirogacestat in combinations across modalities, including with an antibody-drug conjugate, two CAR T cell therapies, two bispecific antibodies and a monoclonal antibody. SpringWorks has also formed research collaborations with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to further characterize the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA therapies using a variety of preclinical multiple myeloma models.

Nirogacestat has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors and from the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The FDA also granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis.

0859 ET - Heavy-duty truck orders are tumbling as supply-chain snarls hit manufacturers. Preliminary net orders for Class-8 trucks in North America fell to 9,500 units in November, says FTR, down 41% from October and 82% from November 2020. Demand remains strong, but FTR says truck makers ""remain very reluctant"" to add to lengthy backlogs because of uncertainty in supply chains. Parts deliveries have been uneven, and shortages in components including semiconductors have kept factories from finishing off new big rigs. Manufacturers will hold back on new orders ""until the supply chain situation improves,"" says FTR's Don Ake. (paul.page@wsj.com)

0856 ET - The emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant and restrictions are weighing on eurozone investor confidence, Pantheon Macroeconomics says. The eurozone Sentix investor sentiment index fell to 13.5 in December from 18.3 in November, its lowest level since April. The decline was driven by a drop in the current conditions gauge, Pantheon's senior Europe economist Melanie Debono says. The fall in the current situation index suggests that markets believe economic growth will slow sharply in the fourth quarter, as Pantheon forecasts. Pantheon expects eurozone GDP growth to slow to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in 4Q, from 3Q's 2.2%. With virus cases and hospitalizations rising, the downside risks to the economic outlook are mounting, Debono says. Pantheon forecasts the Sentix will fall again in January. (maria.martinez@wsj.com)

0847 ET - Julius Baer is attractively priced following a pullback in European banks' shares, UBS says, upgrading its recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral. The Swiss bank's shares are down 15% from recent highs, and the market's reaction to its last update was bearish, likely due to concerns around gross margin trends, UBS says. However, this doesn't change Julius Baer 's good fundamentals: it offers a cash-generative business model, capital build of up to 50 basis points a year--after payout of around 70%--and structural growth opportunities above GDP growth levels, UBS says. Plus, in the event of a market downturn, good cost management would protect its balance sheet, it says. UBS lifts its price target on the stock to CHF71 from CHF63. Shares trade 2.9% higher at CHF59.44. (cristina.roca@wsj.com; @_cristinaroca)

0826 ET - A new study suggests potential for Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine as a ""mix-and-match"" booster shot. The J&J vaccine, when given six months after people received the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine, boosted levels of immune-system antibodies and T-cells in a study at Beth Israel in Boston. The increase in antibodies from the J&J shot was comparable to what a Pfizer booster shot achieved, while it surpassed the Pfizer shot in T-cell responses. It could be a tough sell, however, to convince Pfizer -vaccinated people to get the J&J booster: so far, about 95% of people receiving Pfizer 's vaccine have stuck with the same shot if they got a booster in the US, according to the CDC.

0815 ET - Centrica is set to benefit from higher gas and power prices, even though the operational performance of its upstream business has been historically volatile, Jefferies says. The U.S. bank now expects upstream to account for 41% of the group's EPS in 2021-2025, up from its previous assumption of 29%. As for the energy retail division, the current supplier fallout will enable Centrica to grow its customer base to a 25% market share by 2023, which Jefferies sees as a long-term positive. However, on the flip side, customers are switching to capped-price contracts, which will squeeze margins. Overall, Jefferies upgrades 2021-2023 EPS forecasts by 14% and raises the Centrica target price to 72 pence from 58 pence. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

0749 ET - A change in Vivendi 's stance regarding a spinoff of Telecom Italia 's network could be a way of forcing a higher offer for the telecommunications company, Bryan Garnier analyst Thomas Coudry says, referring to media reports that the French media conglomerate is open to talks on TIM with the Italian government. Vivendi , TIM's largest shareholder, previously said it felt a EUR10.8 billion all-share offer from investment company KKR undervalued TIM. According to the reports, Vivendi would now not oppose a spinoff of TIM's infrastructure network, and could even become a minority shareholder in the new business. Nevertheless, TIM losing control of its network would be detrimental to the industry, Coudry says. Neither Vivendi nor TIM responded to requests for comment. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0748 ET - Leonardo is facing several headwinds which limit the scope for a re-rating of its stock, Bank of America says, therefore downgrading the Italian aerospace, defense and security company to neutral from buy. ""A weaker outlook for the supply chain and growth in the U.S. defence market, ongoing 787 production issues,"" are among the obstacles, it says. Media reports that the Italian state is looking at bringing Leonardo and Italian shipbuilding company Fincantieri closer together would add complexity and could even have a negative impact on Leonardo's valuation, BofA says.

0739 ET - Inditex should post encouraging third-quarter results later this month, Sabadell analysts say, adjusting full-year estimates in light of higher costs. The Spanish fashion retailer looks to have made a strong start to its third quarter to end-October, with sales coming in well ahead of the equivalent period two years ago, a tough comparison base, Sabadell says, adding this should mean good overall results for the quarter. For fiscal 2022, operating profit should be down 7% over two years, largely as a result of higher raw-material prices, the bank predicts, keeping a sell rating amid continued pandemic- and supply-related uncertainty ahead.(joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0738 ET - Guararapes Confeccoes SA , which controls clothing retailer Lojas Riachuelo SA and financing company Midway SA, says it sold its Sao Paulo headquarters building for 170 million reais, the equivalent of $30M. The move was part of the company's efforts to rearrange its capital structure to take better advantage of its resources, Guararapes said. The company said it will rent new headquarters space within the next seven months, and will receive a single payment for the old building at the time of the signing of the contract.

0729 ET - French aerospace-and-defense company Thales delivered a good performance this year with order intake up 28% in the first nine months but its stock has underperfomed its peers, providing an interesting entry point for investors, Bank of America says. ""Thales has seen solid operational performance in FY21, with good order momentum and the disposal of the Transport business,"" the bank says. Thales's stock is currently at a roughly 11% discount in average compared to its peers, it says. BofA upgrades Thales to buy from neutral as it sees no reason for this underperformance, adding that the company has the potential to improve shareholder returns, which isn't priced in either.

This announcement follows the recent closing of the company's acquisition of Shell 's Permian Basin properties on Dec. 1 for net cash of $8.6 billion.

Today's announcement reflects the addition of Shell 's Permian Basin properties, including the previously announced expected 2022 capital expenditures and production associated with that transaction. Highlights include: 


   -- Planned companywide 2022 capital expenditures of $7.2 billion; 
 
   -- The planned capital includes $0.2 billion for Scope 1 and 2 
      emissions-reduction projects across the company's global operations and 
      investments in several early-stage low carbon technology opportunities to 
      address end-use emissions; 
 
   -- Expected 2022 annual average production of 1.8 MMBOED, representing low 
      single-digit percentage underlying growth versus pro forma 2021; 
 
   -- Expected 2022 return of capital to shareholders of $7 billion, 
      representing a 16% increase versus 2021. The company is initiating a 
      three-tier capital return program that will consist of a compelling 
      ordinary dividend tier, a share repurchase tier, and a newly authorized 
      quarterly variable return of cash (VROC) tier. The first VROC of $0.20 
      per share will be paid on Jan. 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of 
      Jan. 3, 2022. 
 
   -- Supplemental material describing the elements of this announcement can be 
      found at www.conocophillips.com/investor. 

ConocoPhillips CEO and Chairman Ryan Lance commented, ""At mid-year, we presented a truly differential 10-year plan that embraced our Triple Mandate for how we will play a valued role in the energy transition: safely produce low cost of supply, low-GHG-intensity barrels to the market, deliver compelling financial and capital returns to investors, and meet a net-zero ambition. Today's announcement builds upon each element of the Triple Mandate and supports our belief that ConocoPhillips is the most durable, investable company in the E&P business. With the recent Permian acquisition, we're in an even stronger position to build upon our success in 2021 as we head into next year.""

Preliminary 2022 Capital Expenditures Budget

ConocoPhillips ' preliminary 2022 capital expenditures budget and operating plan reflect an outlook for next year that is consistent with the company's June 2021 10-year plan, with the inclusion of the Permian acquisition and current estimates for inflation and non-operated activity. This plan honors the company's fundamental principles and capital allocation priorities and is expected to drive improvement in underlying cash from operations (CFO) in support of growing returns of capital to shareholders. Additional details include: 


   -- The planned $7.2 billion in 2022 capital expenditures includes $0.7 
      billion associated with the recent Permian transaction and are consistent 
      on an underlying basis with the market update provided in June 2021. 
      Although inflation and non-operated pressures have accelerated since that 
      update, particularly in the Lower 48, the impacts of those factors have 
      been mitigated by productivity improvements across our global, diverse 
      asset base. This guidance excludes the impacts of potential bolt-on 
      acquisitions or planned dispositions. 
 
   -- Approximately 60% of total planned capital will be directed to the Lower 
      48 for short-cycle investment across the company's extensive, 
      high-quality unconventional asset base. Approximately 40% will be 
      allocated toward mid- and longer-cycle projects across the company's 
      diverse Alaska and International regions, including ongoing project and 
      development activity in Alaska, a second Central Processing Facility in 
      the Montney play, bolt-on developments in Asia Pacific, and both project 
      and development activity in Norway. 
 
   -- Approximately $0.2 billion of the preliminary 2022 capital expenditures 
      budget will be allocated toward energy transition efforts across the 
      company's global operations that are aimed at accelerating the reduction 
      of the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions and evaluating potential 
      investments in end-use (Scope 3) emissions-reduction investments. The 
      planned expenditures include production efficiency measures, methane and 
      flaring intensity-reduction initiatives, asset electrification projects, 
      and investments in several early-stage low-carbon technology 
      opportunities that leverage the company's adjacencies and competencies, 
      such as CCUS and hydrogen. 
 
   -- Based on the preliminary capital budget, the company expects to deliver 
      average full-year 2022 production of 1.8 MMBOED, including expected 
      annual production from the recent Permian transaction of approximately 
      200 MBOED. Guidance also includes the impact of the previously announced 
      conversion from 2-stream to 3-stream reporting for volumes acquired from 
      Concho Resources  and a planned convention change to include production 
      from Libya in the company's guidance beginning in 2022. 
 
   -- This preliminary production guidance excludes the impact of potential 
      bolt-on acquisitions and planned dispositions. 
 
   -- On a pro forma underlying basis, the company's 2022 production estimate 
      represents underlying low-single-digit percentage production growth 
      versus 2021. Underlying growth is expected to be driven by Alaska, 
      including the start up of GMT2, and a modest ramp in the Lower 48 to 
      resume a gradual trajectory toward optimized plateau. 
 
   -- The company expects to provide additional 2022 guidance in conjunction 
      with fourth-quarter 2021 earnings in early February 2022. 

Three-Tiered Returns of Capital Framework

The company also announced its expected 2022 returns of capital program and the initiation of a three-tier returns of capital framework. The three-tier framework is structured to continue delivering a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases, now with the addition of a variable return of cash (VROC) tier. The VROC tier will provide another flexible tool for meeting the company's commitment of returning greater than 30% of CFO during periods when commodity prices are meaningfully higher than the company's planning price range.

The VROC will be determined and approved each quarter by the board of directors at the same time the ordinary dividend is reviewed. The factors considered in determining the VROC will include the anticipated level of distributions required to meet the company's capital returns commitment, forward prices, balance sheet cash and total yield. The VROC will be announced at the same time as the ordinary dividend, but the quarterly payout will be staggered from the ordinary dividend payout, resulting in up to eight cash distributions to shareholders throughout the year.

As the company considers the business outlook, including forward commodity prices, it has set its expected 2022 capital returns to shareholders at $7 billion. This would represent a 16% increase in returns of capital versus 2021 and is expected to be allocated roughly equally between cash and share repurchases across the three distribution tiers as follows: 


   -- The annualized current ordinary dividend, estimated at $2.4 billion 
      subject to board review and approval; 
 
   -- Expected share repurchases of approximately $3.5 billion, including 
      approximately $1 billion funded through remaining Cenovus share sales, 
      and; 
 
   -- A VROC of approximately $1 billion subject to board review and approval, 
      anticipated to be distributed ratably on a quarterly basis. 
 
   -- The first VROC payment of $0.20 per share is payable on Jan. 14, 2022, to 
      shareholders of record as of Jan. 3, 2022. 

""Over the past five years we have consistently delivered on our commitment to return greater than 30% of CFO to shareholders through our attractive ordinary dividend and almost $13 billion of share repurchases, "" added Lance. ""We have been recognized for our through-cycle returns of capital and remain fully committed to this priority. We believe the greatest sustained value from a capital returns program comes from consistent execution and a compelling level of payout, but we also recognize that meeting our returns commitment in the current favorable commodity price environment creates a need for a variable cash tier. The basis of our capital returns approach is CFO-driven, and our new three-tier framework can more easily flex distributions with commodity prices, while retaining some discretion in allocation across the tiers. We are excited to initiate the three-tier program with an immediate cash distribution.""

Lance concluded, ""We are exiting 2021 after a truly exceptional year with a differential long-term plan built around our Triple Mandate. We expect to play an essential role in the energy transition by executing sound investment plans, delivering superior and consistent returns through cycles and meeting our net-zero ambition, while retaining the flexibility to successfully adapt as the future unfolds.""

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 06, 2021-- 

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced a pause in enrollment for the IMPOWER 22 (MK-8591-022) and IMPOWER 24 (MK-8591-024) Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating investigational, once-monthly, oral islatravir (ISL), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in people at high risk of HIV-1 infection.

At the recommendation of the ISL PrEP external data monitoring committee (eDMC), Merck is pausing enrollment for the IMPOWER 22 and IMPOWER 24 trials while the company conducts further analyses of these and other ongoing studies. Participants already enrolled in the trials will continue to receive the study medicine. Informed by the recommendations of the PrEP eDMC, Merck is implementing additional monitoring measures for study participants, including increasing the frequency of total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell assessments. Investigators have been informed of these actions.

""We continue to apply learnings from our HIV program as we move forward with the development of islatravir in both treatment and PrEP,"" said Dr. Joan Butterton, vice president, infectious diseases, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories .

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa., Dec. 13, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Air Products (NYSE:APD) has awarded thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers a contract to supply a more than two-gigawatt (2 GW) electrolysis plant for one of the world's largest green hydrogen projects at NEOM in Saudi Arabia. Under this contract, thyssenkrupp will engineer, procure and fabricate the plant based on their large-scale 20 megawatt (MW) alkaline water electrolysis module. Upon commissioning, the project partners _ NEOM, ACWA Power and Air Products (""NEOM Green Hydrogen Company"") _ will operate the facility, which will produce hydrogen to be synthesized into carbon-free ammonia for export exclusively by Air Products to global markets. Engineering and procurement activities have been initiated, and the start of production is scheduled for 2026.

Strong partnership with strong sustainability lever

In July 2020, Air Products , together with ACWA Power and NEOM, announced the signing of an agreement for world-scale green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility powered by renewable energy. thyssenkrupp was selected by its strategic partner Air Products early in the project as technology supplier and has worked intensively on early engineering and project development. The signing of the project contract is a key milestone of both companies' joint effort over the past year to use their complementary technology, engineering and project execution strengths to develop green hydrogen production facilities. The realization of the project leverages thyssenkrupp 's large-scale technology supporting Air Products ' development of green hydrogen for sustainable transportation, chemicals and power generation.

Dr. Samir J. Serhan , Chief Operating Officer at Air Products, says: ""This project milestone with thyssenkrupp furthers our strong progress at NEOM to deliver carbon-free hydrogen on a massive scale in the Kingdom and for the world. The development and execution of this innovative megaproject is one of many required to drive a successful energy transition, and we look forward to continuing to develop, build, own and operate facilities that help address the world's significant energy and environmental challenges. This project is the kickoff to become a frontrunner in the green hydrogen economy.""

""As a world market leader in electrolysis we bring in two decisive factors to realize such gigawatt projects: With our large-scale standard module size and gigawatt cell manufacturing capacity per year together with our Joint Venture partner De Nora we are able to deliver large capacity projects today,"" says Denis Krude, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers. ""With this gigawatt project, we are committed to invest into ramping up our manufacturing capacities further. We also aim for a strong local setup which is key to delivering customized service solutions throughout the entire plant life-cycle and enables our strategic partner in their vision to become a global decarbonization pioneer.""

Hard Rock said it plans to build an iconic guitar-shaped hotel.

Hard Rock and Vici Properties Inc., which will be the property owner once its acquisition of MGM Growth Properties LLC closes, have reached a long-term lease, and are discussing a $1.5 billion redevelopment plan for the property, Vici said.

MGM Resorts Chief Executive Bill Hornbuckle, who was part of the team that opened The Mirage in 1989, said the deal marked a milestone for MGM Resorts and for Las Vegas.

""The monetization of our entire real property portfolio, together with the addition of CityCenter and our agreement to acquire The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, will position the Company with a fortress balance sheet, premier portfolio, and significant financial resources to pursue our strategic objectives,"" MGM Chairman Paul Salem said in a statement.

Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts has sold some assets, including real-estate holdings, to focus on new business areas such as sports betting, entertainment and a casino development in Japan.

The company swung to a profit of $1.12 billion for the first nine months of the year, as revenue surged 80% to $6.62 billion, with casino revenue more than doubling from the comparable nine-month period a year earlier.

MGM Resorts acquired the 77-acre property, located at the heart of the Las Vegas Strip and known for its 90-foot Strip-side volcano, in 2000.

MGM Resorts' Las Vegas Strip portfolio also includes the Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay.

The transaction: 


   -- Further expands VICI's existing partnership with Hard Rock as they

      upon closing of all pending transactions. 

John Payne , President and Chief Operating Officer of VICI Properties , said, ""We are thrilled to continue to help our tenants achieve mutually beneficial objectives. By working collaboratively with MGM Resorts to sell the Mirage operations we are able to grow our pre-existing partnership with Hard Rock as they expand their gaming operations onto the Las Vegas strip, the most economically productive street in America.""

The lease between VICI Properties and Hard Rock related to the operations of the Mirage will have initial annual base rent of $90 million with other economic terms substantially the same as the MGM Master Lease, including a base term of 25-years with three 10-year tenant renewal options, escalation of 2.0% per annum (with escalation of the greater of 2.0% and CPI, capped at 3.0%, beginning in lease year 11) and minimum capital expenditure requirements of 1.0% of annual net revenue.

Specific terms of the redevelopment and related funding remain under discussion and subject to final documentation between VICI and Hard Rock.

VICI Properties has also agreed, in accordance with, and as contemplated by, the terms of the MGM Master Lease, to amend the MGM Master Lease to account for MGM's divestiture of the operations of the Mirage, which will result in a reduction of the initial annual base rent under the MGM Master Lease by $90 million.

The transactions referenced herein are expected to be completed in the second half of 2022 and are subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and the closing of VICI's previously announced pending acquisition of MGP.

SANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 13, 2021-- 

Keysight Technologies, Inc . (NYSE: KEYS), a leading technology company that delivers advanced design and validation solutions to help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, announced the company is first to gain approval from the Global Certification Forum (GCF) for a conformance test case that enables chipset vendors to verify internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS) based eCall functionality, advancing in-vehicle emergency call capabilities over 4G long term evolution (LTE) networks.

Confirmed by the GCF conformance agreement group in October 2021, Keysight's achievement is formally referred to as LTE and Interworking with eCall in IMS (EIEI). It enables vendors of telematics units to verify IMS-based eCall functionality in compliance to specifications set by 3GPP, the global standards organization. The eCall connection uses voice over LTE (VoLTE) to establish a manual or automatic voice call between the emergency services and the driver or passenger in the vehicle involved in the incident.

""The automotive industry depends on a wide range of reliable communication technologies to develop future-proof cars, trucks, buses and other on-road vehicles,"" said Muthu Kumaran, general manager Keysight's Device Validation Solutions business. ""Keysight plays a key role in helping automobile vendors meet evolving safety requirements by enabling telematics system makers to quickly and easily adopt the latest digital and connectivity platforms.""

Automotive vendors need access to the latest communications solutions, based on LTE, 5G and cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), to deliver continuous safety and convenience for drivers, passengers and pedestrians. IMS enables carriers to cost-effectively deliver rich multimedia services including voice over IP (VoIP), videoconferencing and video on demand (VoD) to end-users. The LTE EIEI test case submission to GCF used Keysight's S8704A Protocol Conformance Toolset, based on the company's E7515B UXM 5G Wireless Test platform.

Philip Morris International : Delivering a Smoke-Free Future

Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. In addition, versions of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of IQOS and its consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products and oral nicotine products. As of September 30, 2021, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets in key cities or nationwide, and PMI estimates that approximately 14.9 million adults around the world have already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.

""This new location will pave the way for hundreds of new IT jobs for Illinois residents and help Illinois continue its long-standing tradition of being at the center of breakthrough discoveries in agricultural and construction technology.""

""Over the past few years, the digital transformation and agility of our business operations have been accelerated by a more modern Information Tech Stack on the foundation of stronger digital and technical skills,"" said Ganesh Jayaram , Vice President of Information Technology at John Deere. ""Chicago offers us the opportunity to augment our technical skills to drive this ongoing modernization of our digital business solutions.""

The investment in Chicago includes an EDGE agreement offered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), a program to support companies making large-scale capital investments and long-term job creation commitments in Illinois communities.

""John Deere's investment in new technology jobs in Chicago reinforces Illinois' place as a global leader in agriculture,"" said DCEO Acting Director Sylvia I. Garcia of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity . ""DCEO looks forward to our continued partnership with John Deere, one Illinois' leading employers, as we advance Governor Pritzker's 5-year economic plan and invest in good paying jobs for Illinoisans.""

",",ccat,gpol,ncmac,nenac,neqac,nfiac,c151,c15,gcat,gpir,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,",,1640331132000,"Even though its guidance was little changed from what the company previously told suppliers, by midweek the letter had been singled out by irate Chinese social-media users and a nationalist state-run tabloid, denouncing Intel's unwillingness to conduct business involving Xinjiang.

On Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker said its letter was written only to comply with U.S. law and didn't represent Intel's stance on Xinjiang.

""We deeply apologize for the confusion caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,"" Intel said in its statement, which was posted on its social-media platforms in China. Intel didn't specify which law it was seeking to comply with.

The incident is the latest example of multinational companies caught in the middle as Western governments pressure companies to disentangle their supply chains from Xinjiang. Sportswear company Adidas AG and fast-fashion giant H&M Hennes and Mauritz AB are among those that have run afoul of social-media users in China. Those that have apologized to Chinese consumers, meanwhile, risk a backlash from lawmakers and consumers back home.

The Intel letter was published in the U.S. on Dec. 16, the same day that the U.S. Senate passed legislation banning imports from the Xinjiang region over concerns about the use of forced labor. President Biden signed the bill, titled the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, into law on Thursday.

The U.S. and other Western governments have sought to punish Beijing over its policies toward Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang, which U.S. government officials, lawmakers and human-rights activists have said amount to genocide.

It also comes just weeks ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Intel is one of 14 global companies that have contracts with the International Olympic Committee to sponsor multiple Olympics. Human-rights groups have put pressure on Olympic sponsors to speak up on human rights or pull out ahead of the Beijing Games, which are slated to begin Feb. 4.

Intel's latest supplier guidance on Xinjiang is similar to what the company said in last year's letter to vendors, when it instructed them to ""ensure Intel does not receive goods/services produced in the Xinjiang region of China."" At a congressional hearing over the summer, Intel General Counsel Steve Rodgers said the company had no goods sourced from the Chinese region and put in place policies to prohibit suppliers being added from there. At the hearing, he also said Intel had spoken out to the IOC of the importance of human rights to the company.

Researchers say China's government has detained as many as one million members of mostly Muslim minorities in a network of internment camps as part of a campaign of forcible assimilation that also includes mass surveillance, forced labor and stringent birth controls.

China's government has rejected those allegations, portraying its campaign in Xinjiang as an innovative effort to fight religious extremism and terrorism.

Later Thursday, Intel said in a statement that it had posted its apology in China ""to address concerns raised by our stakeholders there regarding how we communicated certain legal requirements and policies with our global supplier network."" The company said it would ensure its sourcing complies with relevant rules wherever it operates.

It is hard to tell how organic social-media firestorms are, as Chinese authorities and technology companies heavily censor and moderate discussions within the country.

Researchers of social-media trends and disinformation analyzing Chinese activity have found Communist Party-run news outlets often amplify nationalist Chinese social-media campaigns. After H&M and sports-apparel maker Nike Inc. were hit earlier in the year over their expressions of concern about forced labor in Xinjiang, researchers in Taiwan found state-media outlets and Communist Party-affiliated social-media accounts fanning the flames of anger online.

That said, a boycott against foreign apparel brands leaves Chinese consumers with a plethora of domestic offerings, while in Intel's case, there aren't any clear-cut Chinese alternatives. A Chinese crackdown on Intel chip imports could have big implications for the country's own industry. The U.S. semiconductor giant has a more than 80% market share in so-called CPU chips for desktop personal computers, the brains of the PC. It is also a dominant vendor of such processors for data services, supplying such Chinese companies as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

China was Intel's largest market by revenue from 2018 to 2020. The company, in its latest annual report, said it had around $20 billion in revenue linked to sales in the country, or about 26% of that year's total. Some of those sales are to customers who then export their goods from China. Intel also maintains several offices in China and a chip assembly-and-test facility in Chengdu. More than a decade ago, Intel made a splash when it announced it would put a chip-making plant in Dalian. Chinese regulators this week signed off on Intel selling that facility that now makes memory chips to South Korea's SK Hynix Inc. in a deal agreed to last year.

In an unsigned editorial published after Intel's supplier letter began to circulate, China's state-run Global Times tabloid criticized the company for offending the Chinese people. The paper said Intel's actions were aimed at improving its own standing before the U.S. government and called on Beijing to make it ""increasingly expensive for companies to offend China.""

The editorial also urged China to speed up the localization of its chip supplies.

""An important reason why Intel dares to offend China over the Xinjiang-related affairs is that it holds the monopoly of the global chip market,"" the editorial read.

Karry Wang, a singer with the popular Chinese boy band TFBoys, said Wednesday that he would step down as brand ambassador for Intel over the matter.

""National interests trumps everything,"" the celebrity's management office said in comments posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform.

By late Thursday, Intel's apology was among Weibo's top trending topics, with more than 340 million views. The issue drew comments from users who criticized the American chip maker for what they described as Intel's lack of sincerity.

Others lamented China's reliance on Intel and the lack of domestic alternatives. ""It's not Intel that can't leave us, it's China that can't break off from Intel,"" one user wrote, in a comment that attracted thousands of likes and hundreds of replies. ""We don't have any local products to substitute for Intel's.""

In 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel was among a handful of U.S. companies selling components to China's surveillance industry. Intel, through its venture-capital arm, had also provided seed money, chips and technical solutions to NetPosa Technologies Ltd., a Chinese company providing surveillance technologies to police bureaus in Xinjiang. Intel said at the time that its products were used by customers world-wide for a variety of applications.

NetPosa was placed on a U.S. Commerce Department export blacklist last year, and was added to a Treasury Department investment blacklist last week.

Earlier this year, H&M was wiped off China's internet after the Swedish company said it would stop sourcing from Xinjiang. A Chinese consumer boycott followed, costing the fashion company some $74 million in lost sales in China for the three months ended May 31.

Other consumer brands, including Adidas and Nike, also suffered a decline in China sales after joining a consortium of Western brands that raised concerns over alleged forced-labor practices in Xinjiang.

The two companies expect the deal to close in the second half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals.

UnionBank said it would take on about 1,750 Citigroup employees as part of the deal, adding that the business being acquired had nearly one million customers.

The business had net assets of 17.8 billion Philippine pesos, or the equivalent of $355 million, as of June 30, according to UnionBank disclosures and calculations by The Wall Street Journal. UnionBank said the increase in risk-weighted assets required 9.7 billion Philippine pesos in equity, or the equivalent of $193 million.

This is the bank's third exit since Citigroup said in April it would shed consumer franchises in 13 overseas markets, 10 of them in the Asia-Pacific region. It will continue to offer consumer banking in Hong Kong, Singapore, London and the United Arab Emirates, the bank's four wealth hubs.

In August, Citigroup agreed to sell its Australian consumer franchise to National Australia Bank Ltd. NAB is paying a 250 million Australian dollar premium, the equivalent of $180 million, for the business and said the deal required 1.2 billion Australian dollars of equity in total, or the equivalent of $866 million, including the premium paid.

In South Korea, Citigroup decided to wind down its operations instead of selling them. The plan, which met with some local union resistance, would cost the bank up to $1.5 billion in personnel costs. Citigroup said the closure made financial sense because it would free up $2 billion in equity.

The third-largest U.S. bank by assets, Citigroup has long been the only American company with a sizable retail-banking network across Asia, in addition to a full-fledged institutional business that ranges from investment banking and corporate lending to cash management and trade finance.

Alongside the retail disposals, the bank will sharpen its focus on managing money for the increasing number of wealthy entrepreneurs in the region, and providing services to their businesses.

It plans to recruit 1,100 private bankers and relationship managers in Hong Kong and Singapore and aims to grow assets under management for clients in Asia to $450 billion by 2025.

"Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",",gedu,gscho,cpshrt,c21,ccat,cexpro,gcat,",,1664599896000,"The challenges come as some food manufacturers facing supply disruptions and labor shortages have curtailed shipments to schools and other institutions.

For months, Merchants Foodservice, which serves K-12 schools in Alabama and Mississippi, has received about half of its usual soup inventory, partly as Campbell Soup Co. and Kraft Heinz Co. cut or altered their offerings, said Chief Executive Andy Mercier. The company hasn't been able to find additional soup suppliers, he said, adding that it is offering dry soup mixes instead and suggesting different entrees such as lasagna or shepherd's pie.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture pledged last week to send up to $1.5 billion to states and school districts to help fortify the nation's school-meal program. The funds, which USDA says it hopes to make available in January, are intended to help schools deal with disruptions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The bulk of the funds are expected to flow to as many as 100,000 schools in all 50 states.

During a visit to a school-meal provider in Chicago last week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said that boosting schools' resources should help make them more competitive with private buyers.

Big food makers, like other companies, have struggled to keep up with demand during the pandemic. Early on, many focused on churning out food for grocers as consumers emptied store shelves, and orders from restaurants, schools and other groups dropped.

This year, as demand from schools and other institutions ramped back up, some food companies say, labor, supply and capacity challenges have constrained their ability to supply all their customers.

Kellogg said last month its four U.S. cereal plants weren't running at full capacity, and that it was taking steps such as importing cereal from overseas plants as far away as Australia. The strike, which lasted for more than two months, ended this week as unionized Kellogg workers ratified a new five-year contract.

Campbell told food-service customers in October that the company had temporarily discontinued several sizes of its thermal canned soups, sold to schools and other institutions. The soup maker said supply challenges were affecting its ability to maintain normal service levels, according to a letter from Campbell viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Campbell recommended its line of frozen condensed soups as potential substitutions.

Campbell says it was still able to provide a limited assortment of thermal canned soups to several institutional customers this fall, and that it allocated available products to serve key customers, especially schools and healthcare. Conditions have improved recently, and the company says it told food-service customers last week that it had resumed production of several popular soups.

Campbell CEO Mark Clouse said orders from food-service customers can be smaller than grocers', introducing more time and complexity, which are factors the company weighed during the pandemic. Campbell has made investments and added capacity across its soup business in the past year, Mr. Clouse said, helping it boost production. ""We're not making those same kinds of trade-offs that we were, you know, six months ago,"" Mr. Clouse said.

Kraft Heinz told food-service customers in October that it had decided to exit from its canned-soup business, discontinuing more than a dozen varieties including tomato, chicken noodle and clam chowder, according to a letter from the company viewed by the Journal. The company offered its frozen soups as an alternative.

Pinduoduo Inc. retreated 8.2%, Baidu Inc. declined 7.8%, and JD.com Inc. fell 7.7%.

Didi's beaten-up stock fell further, dropping 22% to $6.07 -- below its $14-a-share IPO price.

Didi didn't give any rationale for the delisting, which it said has received support from its board and would later require a shareholder vote. The company ran into trouble with Beijing almost immediately after its $4.4 billion initial public offering. The IPO blindsided Chinese regulators, who launched a data-security review, pulled Didi products from Chinese app stores and began a broader overhaul of the framework for international listings by Chinese companies.

Washington has been taking a hawkish stance on Chinese companies listed in the U.S. and Beijing is calling its companies to return home. On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that will formalize the process for Chinese companies to be expelled from the U.S. stock market if they fail to hand over their audit working papers for three years in a row.

The SEC's move brings U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies that don't comply with the regulations closer to being delisted, said Louis Lau, director of investments at Brandes Investment Partners.

The key question is how Didi can depart the U.S. stock market, where investors who bought into the IPO have been sitting on losses for months, after Beijing's regulatory assault tanked the company's share price.

The cleanest solution would be for Didi to float in Hong Kong before concluding a U.S. delisting. The option would create the least chaos and is currently a more preferred route by the company as well as Beijing, according to people familiar with the matter. Chinese regulators had nudged the company toward a Hong Kong listing, The Wall Street Journal reported in October.

Didi has asked investment banks to come up with proposals on how a Hong Kong listing and New York delisting might work, according to people familiar with the matter.

One plan that has emerged: Dual listing in Hong Kong and using the money raised there to buy back Didi's American depositary shares in the U.S., the people said. That could lead to a move to pink-sheet trading in the U.S. as trading in Didi shares tilts toward Hong Kong, and an eventual complete U.S. delisting -- though a dual listing could be in place for a long time, they said.

The Cyberspace Administration of China recently signaled to Didi that it wanted the company to delist from the U.S. by the first half of 2022, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.

Didi is aiming for a Hong Kong listing as soon as the first quarter of 2022, people familiar with the matter said. In doing so, it would join a series of U.S.-traded Chinese companies, including Alibaba, that have obtained so-called homecoming listings since late 2019. This, however, puts the Hong Kong stock exchange and securities regulator in a bind, as Didi currently doesn't meet the city's listing requirements.

Unlike most of its counterparts, Didi would probably have to seek what is called a dual-primary listing, given its short lifespan as a public company, rather than going through the less onerous ""secondary listing"" process that Alibaba and many others used. The Hong Kong exchange requires companies to be listed elsewhere for at least two years before seeking a secondary listing governed by more lenient regulations.

A dual-primary listing is nearly equivalent to a full-blown Hong Kong IPO, and subjects the company to all of the city's governance and disclosure requirements.

Didi had been aiming to do its IPO in Hong Kong up until earlier this year, but it had to abandon that plan because the company didn't meet some of the Hong Kong stock exchange's requirements, the Journal has reported.

A costlier alternative for Didi would be for a bidding consortium, perhaps including some of Didi's major shareholders, to bid for the shares they don't already own. In July, the Journal reported that Didi was considering going private, partly to placate regulators.

Given Didi's size -- after Friday's plunge it had a market capitalization just above $29 billion -- the financing requirements would run into the billions of dollars, and selling shareholders would have to be offered a premium to relinquish their stakes. The option is falling out of favor because of the capital and political costs, according to people familiar with the matter.

Didi's pre-IPO shareholders will be able to sell shares near the end of this month, as a 180-day lockup period comes to an end. Its prominent investors include Uber Technologies Inc., SoftBank Group Corp. and Tencent Holdings, all of which have substantial stakes in the company.

Conrad Saldanha, senior portfolio manager for Neuberger Berman's emerging-markets equity strategy, said the broad selloff of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks shows the risk in holding them while rhetoric and regulation between the two countries are heightened.

Mr. Saldanha said his strategy didn't participate in Didi's IPO in part because of regulatory concerns. Last year, his mutual-fund portfolio started to move its stake in Alibaba from American depositary shares to the company's Hong Kong-listed stock.

Changebridge also favors Skechers initiating a dividend, noting that it has ample ability to do so. ""With a dividend, the total return would be less volatile,"" Changebridge Chief Financial Officer Ross Klein tells Barron's. As Skechers knows, appearances matter.

When an Alphabet program called AlphaGo became the best player in the world in 2017, it had benefited from seeing humans play. But it was quickly surpassed by a version called AlphaGo Zero, which was told only the rules, and taught itself creative, and previously unseen, strategies. The game, as Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) puts it, is ""no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge.""

AI enables machines to behave like humans. A subset called machine learning involves training muscular computers using labeled data, so that they can then make educated guesses, or inferences, about raw data, and get better as they go along. A subset of that, called deep learning, uses artificial neural networks modeled on our brains to cut down on the need for human intervention.

There have been two prior AI research booms that fizzled, with the peak of each roughly marked by a movie about a computer gone rogue. In 1968, it was HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and in 1984 it was Skynet in Terminator. This time around the technology has reached escape velocity, for three reasons. First, the world is awash in valuable data. By 2030, humanity will amass enough bits to fill 610 iPhones, each with 128 gigabytes of storage, for every person on earth. Second, advances in data-center chips allow machines to scour that information for insights.

Third, companies are already profiting. AI powers Google's search results, Alexa's speech recognition, and Tesla's self-driving cars. Netflix uses it to not only recommend movies and shows, but also to tweak data speeds on the fly, and guess which thumbnail picture makes a user most likely to click on a title, and even decide the likeliest recipes for creating new hits.

UBS expects AI revenue to grow by 20% a year to $90 billion by 2025. The good news for S&P 500 index investors is that they are already loaded up on key beneficiaries, including Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, and perhaps clearest of all, Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips dominate in the training process for machine learning.

Schmidt, the former Google CEO, says big players have an advantage in their wealth of data, while small ones will benefit from a free flow of capital toward AI start-ups. ""These waves come along and everyone gets boosted up,"" he says. ""Not all of them win, but a few of them win tremendously.""

But UBS says investors are better off looking beyond the biggest AI names to stay clear of regulatory risk. Many smaller names are private, or spoken for, like Xilinx, which is being bought by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). One chip up-and-comer is Marvell Technology (MRVL), valued at $69 billion. Bank of America recently called it the next $100 billion cloud leader. It trades at more than 43 times next year's projected free cash flow. Marvell and larger Broadcom (AVGO) help cloud giants create their own application-specific chips. There are exchange-traded funds that focus on AI, sort of. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) holds plenty of industrial robot makers, like Switzerland's ABB (ABB) and Japan's Fanuc (FANUY).

Schmidt says AI could be 10 to 15 years away from beating the stock market. Chris Natividad, chief investment officer at EquBot, is giving it a go today with the AI Powered Equity ETF (AIEQ). It lets a machine look among standard financial measures, Twitter feeds, Reddit chat boards, and more and decide on its own mix of clues to favor. Performance for the four-year-old fund has been unremarkable, but Natividad believes the machine is getting smarter.

There is plenty of potential for AI mayhem, says Schmidt, who has advised the Defense Department on its use. The technology can keep watch for hypersonic missiles, which can arrive with little warning. ""Imagine if it learns something wrong and it in fact makes the wrong recommendation and starts a war,"" Schmidt says. He has called for China and Russia to swear off the use of automatically launched nuclear weapons.

Tools for making so-called deep fakes, or videos that can make prominent people appear to do or say anything, are open source or widely available. ""The power of video is extraordinary,"" Schmidt says. ""If you produce a false video and you actually tell people it's false, and you then show it to them, they still more or less believe it. That's a human problem.""

And of course, AI doesn't have to kill or destabilize to make us miserable. Schmidt says outrage is shared seven times more than reason. ""Why are we surprised that we're all upset about social media?"" he says. He has written a book with Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, and Daniel Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. It's called The Age of A.I. and Our Human Future .

Schmidt compares AI with electricity and the telephone in its reach and capacity for both good and evil. AI will discover medicines that will save many millions of lives, he says.

""People always talk about, 'Oh, the robots are going to take over the world,' "" he says. ""Not without us watching. And remember, we can always unplug them if we get really worried.""

The social-media company said Monday that Jack Dorsey is stepping down and Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal would take the reins immediately. The Wall Street Journal reported that the departure was driven in part by investors who were uncomfortable with his roles running two large, publicly traded companies. He was in charge of Twitter and digital payments firm Square Inc. Last year activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed for changes at Twitter, including potentially adjusting Mr. Dorsey's role. Twitter shares lost 2.7% Monday.

MICROSOFT CORP.

MSFT -1.8%

Microsoft investors want more transparency on harassment. Shareholders on Tuesday voted to approve an investor proposal demanding the company provide greater disclosure of sexual harassment cases, including an annual report summarizing the number of cases as well as any independent investigations into Microsoft executives. The Wall Street Journal reported this year that Microsoft directors pursued an investigation into a prior romantic relationship between co-founder Bill Gates and a female staffer. Mr. Gates stepped down from the board last year. Microsoft shares lost 1.8% Tuesday.

EXXON MOBIL CORP.

XOM -0.1%

Exxon is powering down its spending over the next five years. The Wednesday announcement from the energy giant coincides with a murky outlook for oil and gas demand, persistent economic risks from Covid-19 and efforts by some countries to wean themselves from fossil fuels. The company said it will maintain lower capital investment levels through 2027, spending between $20 billion and $25 billion a year. Exxon's plans, months in the making, reflect uncertainty about commodity markets as the world attempts to move past Covid-19. Exxon shares ended 0.1% lower Wednesday.

AT&T INC.

T -2.6%

One of CNN's biggest stars lost his prime-time spotlight. On Tuesday the network said it suspended anchor Chris Cuomo indefinitely after records released by the New York attorney general's office revealed efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct. The records showed that Chris Cuomo gave detailed feedback on his brother's statements to the press. The suspension comes as CNN parent company AT&T prepares to merge media assets with those owned by Discovery Inc. AT&T shares fell 2.6% Wednesday.

SALESFORCE.COM INC.

CRM -12%

Salesforce is sticking by its sales goal. The business-software company on Tuesday reiterated its target of surpassing $30 billion in annual revenue in the next fiscal year, despite issuing a muted revenue outlook that fell short of expectations. Salesforce offers cloud-based software that became widely adopted during the pandemic, as businesses adapted to remote work. The company also named Bret Taylor, the company's president and chief operating officer, as co-CEO to work alongside longtime chief Marc Benioff. Salesforce.com lost 12% Wednesday.

KROGER CO.

KR +11%

Consumers still have an appetite for dining at home. Kroger reported strong sales for the latest quarter as shoppers continued to opt for home-cooked meals. However, the Cincinnati-based grocer said higher supply-chain costs are squeezing its profits as it tries to keep shelves stocked. As products get more expensive, Kroger said consumers are becoming price-sensitive. The company said it is passing costs to customers where possible and is choosing to hold down prices in certain areas. Kroger shares gained 11% Thursday.

MODERNA INC.

MRNA +12%

Omicron may give vaccine makers a shot in the arm. The prospect of new demand for booster shots -- as well as medicines to treat disease caused by the new strain of Covid-19 -- lifted the stock prices of Moderna and Pfizer Inc. Moderna said it is testing whether its Covid vaccine is effective against the Omicron variant, while developing a modified vaccine that specifically targets the variant. Moderna shares soared 12% Monday.

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder Rights Law Firm Johnson & Fistel, LLP is investigating potential legal claims for investors in the companies listed below.

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are global financial services institutions that served as prime brokers for Archegos Capital Management (""Archegos""), a family office with $10 billion under management. Recently, class action complaints were filed against Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for allegedly selling large amounts of shares on or about March 25, 2021, based upon material, non-public information about Archegos and its need to liquidate its stock positions because of margin call pressure fully. As a result of these sales, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley avoided billions in losses.

Specifically, Johnson Fistel 's investigation seeks to determine whether Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may be held liable to purchasers of the common stock of the following companies, between March 22, 2021 and March 29, 2021, for their investment losses:

Twitter's CEO flew the coop. The social-media company said Monday that Jack Dorsey was stepping down and Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal would take the reins effective immediately. The Wall Street Journal reported that the departure was driven in part by investors who were uncomfortable with him running two large, publicly traded companies. He was in charge of Twitter and digital payments firm Square Inc., which is changing its corporate name to Block Inc. Last year activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed for changes at Twitter, including potentially adjusting Mr. Dorsey's role. Twitter shares lost 2.7% Monday.

Microsoft Corp.

Microsoft investors want more transparency on harassment. Shareholders on Tuesday voted to approve an investor proposal to the company demanding greater disclosure on its handling of sexual harassment cases. The proposal requested an annual report that summarized the number of cases investigated and their resolution, as well as results of any independent investigation into Microsoft's executives, including co-founder Bill Gates. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this year said Microsoft board members pursued an investigation into the billionaire's prior romantic relationship with a female staffer. Mr. Gates stepped down from the board last year. Microsoft shares lost 1.8% Tuesday.

Exxon Mobil Corp.

Exxon is powering down its spending over the next five years. The Wednesday announcement from the energy giant coincides with a murky outlook for oil and gas demand, persistent economic risks from Covid-19 and efforts by some countries to wean themselves from fossil fuels. The company said it would maintain lower capital investment levels through 2027, spending between $20 billion and $25 billion a year. That is a 17% to 33% decrease from its pre-pandemic plans. Exxon's plans have been months in the making and aren't an immediate reaction to the new Omicron variant, but they reflect uncertainty about commodity markets as the world attempts to move past Covid-19. Exxon shares ended 0.1% lower Wednesday.

AT&T Inc.

One of CNN's biggest stars lost his prime-time spotlight. In a statement released Tuesday, the network said it suspended anchor Chris Cuomo indefinitely after records released by the New York attorney general's office provided a detailed look into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct. The records showed that Chris Cuomo gave detailed feedback on his brother's statements to the press and gathered information about coming stories involving his brother's accusers. Mr. Cuomo's suspension comes as CNN's parent company, AT&T, is preparing to merge its media assets with those owned by Discovery Inc. AT&T shares fell 2.6% Wednesday.

Salesforce.com Inc.

Salesforce is sticking by its sales goal. The business-software company on Tuesday reiterated its target of surpassing $30 billion in annual revenue in the next fiscal year, despite issuing a muted revenue outlook that fell short of expectations. Salesforce was a pioneer in offering cloud-based software that became widely adopted during the pandemic, as businesses embraced such tools to function better with remote staff. The company also named Bret Taylor, the company's president and chief operating officer, as co-CEO to work alongside longtime chief Marc Benioff. Salesforce.com lost 12% Wednesday.

Kroger Co.

Consumers still have an appetite for dining at home. Kroger reported strong sales for the latest quarter as shoppers continued to opt for home-cooked meals. However, the Cincinnati-based grocer said higher supply-chain costs are squeezing its profit, that it has more inventory today than a year ago and that it incurred significant costs to keep its shelves stocked. Meanwhile, most products are getting more expensive, and Kroger said consumers are becoming price-sensitive and feeling the effects of inflation. The company said it is passing down costs to customers where possible and is choosing to hold down prices in some areas. Kroger shares gained 11% Thursday.

That brought the stock's gains for the year to more than 60%, outperforming many of the younger and much-faster-growing cloud companies that are increasingly challenging Oracle's storied enterprise software business.

Oracle's own cloud offerings have been gaining traction and boosting the company's prospects; the company has averaged nearly 6% revenue growth year over year for the past three quarters, its best consecutive performance in nearly four years.

The $28 billion acquisition of Cerner announced Monday morning appears to be testing investors' faith a bit. Oracle's shares fell 5.2%, adding to a 6% drop after The Wall Street Journal first reported the pending deal on Friday. The deal is Oracle's largest ever -- more than triple the $9.3 billion spent to buy NetSuite in 2016. It also raises the prospect that Oracle might go back to its M&A-hungry days. The 2005 acquisition of PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion kicked off a decadelong spree that saw Oracle roll up 110 companies -- three of which had deal values over $1 billion, according to FactSet.

That worry may be somewhat overblown. Software has become an expensive ground to hunt in. The S&P 500 Software & Services Group trades at an average of 31 times forward earnings, a 50% premium to the main S&P 500 index. That compares with a 10% premium five years ago, and doesn't even include many of the hottest cloud names still losing money and trading at more than 30 times forward sales.

Prices like that make any buyer choosy out of necessity. And while Oracle generates a normalized free cash flow of around $12 billion a year, its growing net debt position -- driven in part by a furious pace of stock buybacks -- makes it a challenge to compete with other acquisitive software giants such as Microsoft and Salesforce.com.

But Cerner seems a solid find in that respect. The company specializes in electronic medical records and is expected by analysts to generate a little over $6 billion in revenue next year. That would add about 14% to Oracle's top line. But Cerner's share price has been in a slump, up just 2% for the year before reports of Oracle's interest. The deal thus values Cerner around five times forward sales, which Brent Thill of Jefferies notes ""looks attractive in today's valuation environment.""

The challenge for Oracle will be to show that it doesn't need to rely on megadeals to keep up its recent performance. And while the company hasn't been under the same scrutiny as its main cloud-computing rivals Amazon.com, Google and Microsoft, Tyler Radke of Citi notes that regulators may still watch the deal closely, especially given Cerner's core business of sensitive medical data. Closing this deal may prove to be Oracle's toughest sales job yet.

BERLIN & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 21, 2021-- 

Global music company BMG and global investment firm KKR today announced that they have acquired the entire music interests of American rock icons ZZ Top.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211221005092/en/ 

Credit: Ross Halfin

The transaction marks the latest significant music rights deal the two companies have struck together since announcing in March 2021 that they would join forces in the fast-growing market for music IP.

The ZZ Top agreement includes a buyout of the band's publishing catalogue and their income from recorded royalties and performance royalties. Previously, BMG served as co-publisher and administrator of ZZ Top's publishing catalog.

In 1971, Billy Gibbons (guitar, vocals), Dusty Hill (bass, keys, vocals), and Frank Beard (drums) released their debut album ZZ Top's First Album. They would go on to release a total of 15 albums throughout the course of their 50 year career including the commercial breakthrough Tres Hombres (1973), Platinum-certified Degüello (1979), Gold-certified El Loco (1981), smash-hit Diamond-certified Eliminator (1983), 5x Platinum-certified Afterburner (1985), and the Platinum-certified Recycler (1990) and Antenna (1994).

Selling over 50 million albums worldwide, ZZ Top have earned four Gold, three Platinum, two multiple-Platinum album certifications, and one Diamond album. Known for their distinctive look and unabashed blues-rock inspired sound, the success of the group was driven by six #1 Rock singles and eight Top 40 hits including rock music staples 'La Grange,' 'Tush,' 'Cheap Sunglasses,' 'Gimme All Your Lovin,"" 'Legs,' 'Got Me Under Pressure,' and 'Sharp Dressed Man,' among many others.

In 2004, the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and their recently released documentary That Little Ol' Band From Texas received a nomination for Best Music Film at the 2021 Grammy Awards.

ZZ Top manager Carl Stubner of Shelter Music Group said, ""We are proud to continue working with and expand our long-standing relationship with BMG. This new deal ensures ZZ Top's remarkable legacy will endure for generations to come.""

BMG CEO Hartwig Masuch said, ""This deal is a testament to the success, staying power and continuing musical relevance of ZZ Top, but also to the power of our partnership with KKR . This agreement furthers our vision of providing artists and songwriters not just a financial exit, but also a vehicle committed to respecting and treasuring their artistry.""

Jenny Box, Partner at KKR , said, ""We are excited to invest in ZZ Top's iconic music and we look forward to collaborating with BMG and ZZ Top to further amplify the reach of their catalogue.""

KKR is investing in the catalogue through its private credit investment funds and vehicles and will own its interest in the music through its recently launched Chord Music Partners platform. Latham & Watkins LLP served as advisor to KKR on the transaction.

But, like the Cerner acquisition, it demonstrated Mr. Ellison's desire to elevate Oracle in the fast-growing, cloud-computing business where the company has long lagged behind other tech companies including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, analysts said.

The Cerner deal, discussions for which were first reported last week by The Wall Street Journal, gives Oracle a major presence in an industry that is one of the top drivers of growth for cloud computing. Mr. Ellison said earlier this month that healthcare is one of the key focus areas for his company, telling analysts that it was ""on par with banking in terms of the importance to our future.""

He said Monday, ""With this acquisition, Oracle's corporate mission expands to assume the responsibility to provide our overworked medical professionals with a new generation of easier-to-use digital tools that enable access to information via a hands-free voice interface to secure cloud applications.""

Healthcare has emerged as a battleground for cloud companies, analysts say, because the industry is so big -- U.S. healthcare spending accounts for nearly 20% of the country's gross domestic product -- and has often been slow to adopt the latest digital tools.

Cerner sells software that hospitals and doctors use to store and analyze medical records. It is the second-largest vendor in the market after Epic Systems Corp. Staking a claim in a top healthcare software vendor could be a smart move for Oracle as the opportunity to move Cerner's data to the cloud will be massive, said Ray Wang, founder of Silicon Valley-based advisory firm Constellation Research Inc.

Not all investors appear to agree. Oracle's shares fell 5.2% Monday, following a 6%-plus drop Friday after news of the potential deal surfaced. Oracle's shares had been up more than 50% since the beginning of the year, with a large gain in recent weeks following the company's report of stronger-than-expected cloud revenue.

Cerner shares, which leapt 13% Friday, rose 0.8% Monday to $90.49. The all-cash deal, which still requires regulatory approval, values Cerner at $95 a share, Oracle said.

The market for software that stores and analyzes medical records is on track to reach $29.1 billion in sales this year and could grow to $35.5 billion by 2025, according to Constellation Research. Much of that spending is still on in-house computer systems and is expected to migrate to the cloud platforms.

Oracle was slow to move into the cloud. Mr. Ellison once derided the term before trying to establish Oracle as a cloud player in recent years. It remains a tiny player among still fast-growing giants.

Among U.S. companies, Amazon continues to dominate with 46.5% global market share in 2020, followed by Microsoft at 14% and Google at 4.8%, according to market research firm International Data Corp. The Oracle cloud platform consisted of only half a percent globally in 2020, said the research firm.

The cloud giants are all rolling out tools designed to ease the adoption of the cloud in the healthcare industry. Microsoft has also taken the acquisition route for entering the industry. This year, it made a $16 billion deal to acquire Nuance Communications Inc., an expert in speech-recognition software widely used by healthcare professionals.

Cerner, a software company founded in 1979, has been embracing the cloud in recent years. In 2019, Cerner selected Amazon Web Services as its main partner for moving to the cloud.

By acquiring Cerner, which was advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Centerview Partners, Mr. Ellison could be trying to buy a strategic healthcare customer away from Amazon, analysts said. Cerner is a customer for Oracle's database products, but Amazon has been its preferred cloud provider. Oracle on Monday said Cerner would serve as its ""anchor asset"" to expand in healthcare.

Acquiring Cerner would easily top Oracle's next-largest transaction, the roughly $10 billion purchase of enterprise-software firm PeopleSoft Inc. that closed in 2005, followed by a $9 billion deal for cloud-software provider NetSuite Inc. in 2016.

Some investors worry the all-cash deal could slow Oracle's steady pace of share repurchases, according to analysts.

Mr. Ellison built Oracle into a major power in business software in part through a long list of acquisitions over the decades.

Procter & Gamble said it was recalling several U.S. produced aerosol conditioners and shampoos after benzene, a human carcinogen, was detected in some products. This follows a previous recall last month of two other P&G brands of aerosol dry shampoo products after benzene findings. This may carry negative social implications and raise concerns regarding the quality and safety of P&G 's products. Benzene can cause leukemia, blood cancer of the bone marrow as well as life-threatening blood disorders.

The previous quarter Nike reported a 10-week delay in production because of a lockdown in Vietnam and said it expected flat revenue growth for the November quarter.

On Monday, Nike said revenue in China, Asia Pacific and Latin America declined mainly because of low inventory levels resulting from Covid-19-related factory closures. Local mandates in China to reduce the spread of Covid-19 affected operations of a quarter of Nike's retail partners and half the factories that work with the company.

The company said measures to stop the spread of the virus in China continue to drive volatility in retail traffic but that it saw traffic recover to pre-pandemic levels at times throughout the quarter.

Nike executives said they expect the inventory situation to improve. The company said it forecasts growth to be in the lower single digits for the third quarter because of the continuing impact from lost production from pandemic-related disruptions in Vietnam. The lockdown in Vietnam caused Nike to cancel production of roughly 130 million units.

""Compared to ninety days ago we are increasingly confident supply will normalize heading into fiscal 2023,"" Finance Chief Matthew Friend said on a conference call. Mr. Friend said that all factories in Vietnam were operational and production was at about 80% of what it was before the closures.

More than half of Nike's footwear and about a third of its apparel manufacturing occurs in Vietnam, where Covid-19 cases had the highest daily average last week.

Nike's net income for the November quarter was $1.3 billion, up 7% from a year earlier. Earnings per share were 83 cents, exceeding what analysts had projected.

Direct sales rose 9% to $4.7 billion. Digital sales increased 12%.

With the Omicron variant spreading quickly around the world, there is new uncertainty about whether port or factory closures could interfere with production or shipping schedules. Some countries are imposing restrictions to curb the number of infections.

""We're going to continue to watch it closely like everyone else,"" Mr. Friend said about the Omicron variant. He said given the consumer demand for Nike's products he believes the company's forecasts were reflective of what it sees in the intermediate term.

Nike last week said it acquired Rtfkt, a startup that creates nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, of sneakers and other collectibles. The company didn't disclose the details of the deal. Nike also recently filed trademark applications indicating it wants to sell NFTs of its sneakers, clothing and other goods stamped with its swoosh logo.

Analysts say the moves speak to the company's ambitions to quickly enter the market for virtual goods and reflect the acceleration of its digital strategy. It could also help Nike sidestep the supply crunch. Competitor Adidas AG launched a collection of NFTs last week and raked in about $23 million.

CARLSBAD, Calif., Dec. 21, 2021

CARLSBAD, Calif., Dec. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Thermo Fisher Scientific , the world leader in serving science, today announced an update to its Applied Biosystems TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Panel to enable direct detection of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant. The panel is designed with a customizable menu of real-PCR genotyping assays to accurately identify known SARS-COV-2 variants in just over an hour.

South African researchers first identified the Omicron variant in November 2021 and it has since been detected in dozens of countries in the weeks that followed. The discovery has prompted further studies examining its potential for increased transmissibility or the ability to subvert protection from vaccines. These properties are believed to stem from mutations found in the Omicron variant, including multiple modifications in the S gene [G339D and Q493R]. The new assays were developed two weeks after the WHO classified Omicron as a variant of concern, enabling public health laboratories to quickly evolve their surveillance testing programs in response.

The TaqMan SARS CoV-2 Mutation Panel is compatible with real-time PCR instruments already commonly used in laboratories around the world. Labs can choose from a menu of over 50 known mutations of SARS-CoV-2 to build their unique panel, which is designed to be highly scalable, and run up to several hundred samples to monitor for one or multiple mutations simultaneously. This empowers labs to be flexible based on the testing needs in their area.

""The emergence of the Omicron variant has shown how important it is to have continued surveillance testing,"" said Manoj Gandhi, senior medical director for genetic testing solutions, Thermo Fisher Scientific . ""The TaqMan Mutation Panel can be easily tuned to account for such emerging variants, allowing laboratories to conduct large-scale surveillance testing in this phase of the pandemic. This will allow public health agencies to track the Omicron variant and determine if countermeasures need to be implemented to mitigate the spread.""

(NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of data, technology, and market infrastructure, today announced that it has transitioned all open interest held in its LIBOR-based Three Month Sterling futures and options and Three Month Euro Swiss Franc (Euroswiss) futures into their risk free rate (RFR) equivalent contracts, Three Month SONIA Index futures and options and Three Month SARON Index futures.

The transition took place following the close of business on December 17, 2021.

""The transition completes ICE 's LIBOR cessation process for these contracts and ICE SONIA is now the benchmark contract for managing U.K. short term interest rate risk,"" said Steve Hamilton, Global Head of Financial Derivatives at ICE . ""Through continued innovation over the past few years and by closely supporting our customers through their transition to new alternative rate markets, ICE offers its customers the greatest liquidity to manage U.K. and Swiss interest rate risk as part of a broad multi-currency rate product suite.""

As outlined in April 2021 following a market consultation, ICE converted LIBOR-referenced contracts into the notional equivalent number of RFR-referenced contracts, applying the relevant spread for fallbacks in ISDA documentation to the conversion. Two Three Month Sterling futures were converted into one Three Month SONIA Index future with the same delivery month, reflecting how one SONIA future is double the notional value of a Sterling future, while the conversion of Three Month Euroswiss positions to SARON was a straight one for one conversion.

A total of 3,512,101 Sterling contracts and 145,082 Euroswiss contracts were transitioned. Open interest in SONIA futures and options stands at 6,976,654 with open interest of 153,208 in SARON.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Mohawk Industries, Inc . (MHK) and Mohawk Capital Finance S.A., including MHK's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The IDR reflects the company's leading market positions in flooring products and ceramics and its position as the largest flooring manufacturer globally. The ratings consider the company's conservative capital allocation strategy, as evidenced by total debt to operating EBITDA maintaining below 2x, only exiting this range for short periods for acquisition opportunities. The company's strong geographic and customer diversity relative to peers support the 'BBB+' rating. Earnings cyclicality inherent to building products companies serving consumer, residential and nonresidential markets is also factored into the rating.

Key Rating Drivers

Stable Earnings Outlook: Fitch forecasts a relatively stable earnings outlook for MHK in 2022, supported by product price increases and recovering nonresidential construction markets. Fitch expects revenues to increase about 4% next year following 17% revenue growth in 2021. Fitch forecasts raw material and energy inflation and supply chain bottlenecks to cause EBITDA margins to contract to about 16% of revenues in 2022 compared to 17.5% in 2021.

Fitch forecasts revenues to flatten or decline modestly in 2023 and 2024, which assumes slowing residential end-markets in these years, partially offset by continued improvement in nonresidential construction markets. Fitch expects operating EBITDA margins to situate in the 15%-16% range beyond 2022, supporting consistently positive FCF generation and conservative credit metrics over the intermediate term.

Risks to Fitch's intermediate-term earnings outlook include worsening inflation and persistent, long-term supply chain and manufacturing constraints which could continue to impact sales volumes and margins. Additionally, further price increases could be more challenging to successfully implement if demand were to soften, which could result in worse margin performance than Fitch currently anticipates.

Conservative Capital Allocation: Mohawk has maintained stronger credit metrics than most of its 'BBB' category investment-grade peers over the past several years. The company typically maintains total debt/operating EBITDA at or below 2x and only exits that range for 18-24 months for acquisition opportunities. Total debt to operating EBITDA for the LTM period ended Oct. 2, 2021 (pro forma for 4Q21 debt reduction) was 0.8x. Fitch expects Mohawk to maintain total debt to operating EBITDA in the 1.0x to 2.0x range over the intermediate term. Fitch's leverage forecast assumes M&A activity increases in the next few years, consistent with the company's growth strategy.

Strong Financial Flexibility: Fitch believes the company has strong enough liquidity to comfortably manage upcoming debt maturities, supported by the full $1.8 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility at the end of 3Q21. The company has reduced gross debt by about $1.0 billion YTD with FCF and excess cash on hand. Fitch believes the company's revolver availability and cash balance allows them the flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions, capacity expansion, and handle potential legal fees or settlements without compromising overall financial flexibility or liquidity.

Leading Market Position: Mohawk has leading market positions in most flooring categories that it competes in and is the largest flooring manufacturer globally. Fitch estimates the company has about a 20% market share in the North American flooring industry and leading market positions in ceramics globally. Fitch believes the company's leadership positions provides competitive advantages, such as access to a wide range of distribution channels, fixed cost leverage and a platform to execute organic and inorganic growth initiatives. Additionally, companies such as MHK with leading brands across product categories typically generate strong profitability.

Diverse Source of Revenues: The company's end-market exposure is predominantly focused on residential markets within the U.S. combined with some exposure to commercial end-markets, providing the company with exposure to sectors with typically differing cycling timing. However, the company has modest exposure to the more highly cyclical new construction market, which is a risk to the stability of profitability through economic cycles. Mohawk's customer base is more diverse than similarly-rated peers, which tend to have higher exposures to home center customers.

Ongoing Investigation and Class Action Case: The Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a lawsuit in 2020 claiming that Mohawk engaged in fraudulent schemes to misrepresent its financials from April 2017 to July 2019. The conclusion of the internal investigation by Mohawk's Audit Committee in late 2020 that allegations of fraud are without merit, combined the fact that historical financial results were not restated, alleviated some of Fitch's concerns regarding material weakness in Mohawk's internal controls and reliability of historical financial statements. Both the securities class action case and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia (USAO) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations into the matters are still ongoing.

Fitch will continue to monitor the progress in both the class action case and the government investigations into the allegations in assessing future rating actions, but it is Fitch's current view that the risk that there are ongoing severe corporate governance or financial reporting failures has lessened. Negative rating action may occur in the intermediate to long term if findings in the USAO and the SEC suggest a material failure in corporate governance has occurred absent proper remediation.

Derivation Summary

Mohawk's credit metrics are better positioned relative to 'BBB' category U.S. building products peers, including Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc . (FBHS; BBB/Stable) and Whirlpool Corp . (WHR; BBB/Stable). The company has employed a more conservative capital allocation strategy than these peers historically.

Mohawk's market position is comparable to investment-grade building products peers, which are typically top players in the products they compete in. Mohawk's end-market and geographic diversity are stronger than Masco Corporation (BBB/Stable) and FBHS, but weaker than 'A' category peers such as Stanley Black & Decker, Inc . (A-/Stable) and PPG Industries, Inc . (A-/Negative).

Key Assumptions

Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer

--Revenues increase 17% in 2021 and mid-single digit percentages in 2022.

--EBITDA margins improve to 17.5% in 2021 and decline to 16.2% in 2022 due to cost inflation.

--Flat to slightly lower revenues and EBITDA margins in 2023 and 2024, which assumes a slowdown in consumer demand.

--Capex in 2022 increases to over $800 million (about 7% of sales) as the company expands production capacity.

--FCF generation of about 6.5% of revenues in 2021 and 5.5% of revenues in 2022.

--Combination of FCF and debt financing applied towards opportunistic M&A during the rating horizon.

--Total debt to operating EBITDA situates in the 1.0x to 2.0x range in the intermediate term.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:

--Fitch's expectation that total debt to operating EBITDA and FFO net leverage will be sustained below 1.0x on a long-term basis, supported by management adopting more conservative financial policies. In assessing positive actions, Fitch will also consider developments in ongoing investigations and lawsuits and their potential impact on the company's financial flexibility and Fitch's view of corporate governance strength.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:

--Fitch's expectation that total debt to operating EBITDA or FFO net leverage will consistently be above 2.0x due to factors such as poor operational performance or the company adopting a more aggressive capital allocation policy;

--A material judgment or other developments related to the fraud lawsuit and ongoing government investigations that undermine Fitch's view of management credibility, corporate governance strength, and the quality of financial disclosures.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579 .

Liquidity and Debt Structure

Strong Liquidity Position: MHK has a strong liquidity position supported by the company's FCF generation and revolver and commercial paper borrowing capacity. As of Oct. 2, 2021, the company had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and full availability under its $1.8 billion revolving credit facility which matures in October 2024. Following the end of 3Q21, the company redeemed all of its EUR500 million unsecured notes due 2022 using cash on hand. The company's next debt maturity is in February 2023, when a $600 million note comes due.

REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations

Mohawk Industries, Inc . has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Financial Transparency due to fraud allegations, which could worsen Fitch's view of corporate governance strength should ongoing government investigations deem that material misrepresentation or misstatement of financial disclosures has occurred. This has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the ratings in conjunction with other factors.

Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

Rio Tinto , which has two lithium projects, agreed to buy a third from Rincon Mining for $825M. Rio has yet to reach commercial lithium production at any of its sites.

1325 ET - Bikram's Yoga College received bankruptcy court approval for a deal with American Express over control of intellectual property. Hot yoga pioneer Bikram Choudhury pledged company assets in 2015 for an AmEx loan. The lender says it has a $635,159 senior secured claim in the bankruptcy, with collateral including trademarks. To avoid litigation over the claim, and to ensure that some IP sale proceeds go to other creditors, chapter 7 trustee Robbin Itkin and AmEx reached a settlement approved Monday. Terms include AmEx getting half of the net proceeds from the IP sales, up to the amount of its secured claim. If the proceeds don't cover the entire secured claim, then the shortfall will be treated as an unsecured claim. (becky.yerak@wsj.com; @beckyyerak)

1227 ET - Federal Reserve Bank of New York research says central-bank bond buying done in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, did a good job of restoring market functioning in the face of heavy stress. ""While it is difficult to pin down the effects of the Fed's purchases amidst the pandemic and numerous policy actions, the evidence suggests they were effective,"" says Michael Fleming, Haoyang Liu, Rich Podjasek, and Jake Schurmeier for the bank. The paper did add that the purchases were not a panacea, and the fact that the Fed rode to the market's rescue may increase moral hazard risks and make market participants believe the central bank will bail them out next time there's trouble.

1200 ET - US consumers, flush with stimulus money, are snapping up manufactured goods and scarce materials. US economic output is set to expand by more than 7% in 4Q, up sequentially from about 2%, according to the Atlanta Fed . That compares with expected annualized growth of about 2% in the eurozone and 4% in China for 4Q, according to JPMorgan . Major US ports are processing almost one-fifth more container volume this year than in 2019, even as volumes at major European ports are roughly flat or lag 2019 levels. The busiest US container ports are leaping ahead of counterparts in Asia and Europe in global rankings as volumes surge, according to Alphaliner. The booming US economy is leaving supply chains struggling to keep up, pushing up prices and inducing overseas companies to invest in the US. (tom.fairless@wsj.com)

1142 ET - Sanderson Farms says the Justice Department wants more information about its deal to sell itself to Cargill and Continental Grain , which owns poultry company Wayne Farms , before it can bless the merger. Sanderson received a second request from the DOJ this week in regards to its antitrust review of the deal, the company says in a securities filing. The companies say the deal is now expected to be completed in 1H of next year after originally anticipating it to be finalized by the fourth calendar quarter of 2021 or in the first calendar quarter of 2022. ""There has been consistent rhetoric from the Biden administration directed toward the meat industry, but it remains to be seen whether these factors translate into legitimate scrutiny of this deal,"" says Ben Bienvenu , an agribusiness analyst at Stephens.

1106 ET - Rivian Automotive climbs 4.4% as the stock recoups some of its 19% plunge over the past two sessions that was driven by investor concerns over delays to its rollout of the R1T EV pickup truck. The electric vehicle startup said Thursday it's already delivered 384 of the pickups, which would theoretically make them the first regular-sized EV pickup truck ever to hit the market. But in previous statements it said ""nearly all"" of its initial deliveries were going to employees rather than regular customers, which could suggest they're more like testing, preproduction vehicles that still have plenty of kinks to be worked out. Rivian officials weren't immediately available for comment. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)By Jeffrey T. Lewis Bridgeline Digital Inc.'s shares dropped 17% to $2.24 after the software company reported a net loss in its fourth quarter.

The cloud-based marketing specialist's shares spiked to a two-year high of $14.38 in July, and have steadily declined since then.

The Woburn, Mass.-based company on Monday reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3.4 million in the three months through Sept. 30, compared with net income of $1.1 million the same period a year earlier.

The company said the loss reflected a $2 million deemed dividend on convertible preferred stock. Write to Jeffrey T. Lewis at jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com

1044 ET - Redfin says 30.3% of its website users nationwide looked to move to a different metro area in October and November, down from a record 31.5% in 1Q but well above prepandemic levels. Homebuyers interest are showing significantly more interest in relocating than before the pandemic, when levels stood at 25% to 26%. ""Now the labor market is incredibly tight,"" Redfin says, ""which means even homebuyers with in-person occupations can move somewhere new and be confident they can secure employment in their new town."" Miami was the most popular migration destination of any major U.S. metro for the fourth month in a row, then Phoenix, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Tampa. Many investors or people who are relocating are coming from places like California, Oregon, New York and New Jersey. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

Effective August 1, 2018, the Board of Invesco High Income Trust II (NYSE: VLT) approved a Managed Distribution Plan (the ""VLT Plan"") for the Fund, whereby the Fund increased its monthly dividend to common shareholders to a stated fixed monthly distribution amount based on a distribution rate of 8.5 percent of the closing market price per share as of August 1, 2018, the date the VLT Plan became effective. The VTA Plan, the VVR Plan and the VLT Plan are collectively referred to herein as the ""Plans.""

Effective October 1, 2020, the Board of Invesco Senior Income Trust (NYSE: VVR) approved a Managed Distribution Plan (the ""VVR Plan"") for the Fund, whereby the Fund pays its monthly dividend to common shareholders at a stated fixed monthly distribution amount of $0.021 per share.

(1) A portion of this distribution is estimated to be from a return of principal rather than net income. The Section 19 notice referenced below provides more information and can be found on the Invesco website at www.invesco.com.

(2.) This distribution is an additional dividend paid to meet federal income and excise requirements, such as Subchapter M (RIC status) and Section 4982 (Minimum Distribution Rules). This distribution does not change the terms of the Plan.

The Plans are intended to provide shareholders with a consistent, but not guaranteed, periodic cash payment from each Fund, regardless of when or whether income is earned, or capital gains are realized. If a Fund's investment income is not sufficient to cover the Fund's intended monthly distribution, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution level under its Plan.

The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the sources indicated. You should not draw any conclusions about the Funds' investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Plans. All amounts are expressed per common share. Each Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution is estimated to be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Funds' investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend on each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

* Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will report distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund's annual report to shareholders will include information regarding the tax character of Fund distributions for the fiscal year. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions in 2021 will be made after the end of the year.

The monthly distributions are based on estimates and terms of each Fund's Plan. Monthly distribution amounts may vary from these estimates based on a multitude of factors. Changes in portfolio and market conditions may cause deviations from estimates. These estimates should not be taken as indication of a Fund's earnings and performance. The actual amounts and its sources may be subject to additional adjustments and will be reported after year end.

Each Fund's Performance and Distribution Rate Information disclosed in the table below is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Fiscal Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate and the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate. Each Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. NAV performance may be indicative of a Fund's investment performance. The value of a shareholder's investment in each Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.

(1) Fiscal year-to-date Cumulative Total Return assumes reinvestment of distributions. This is calculated as the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over the fiscal year-to-date time period including distributions paid and reinvested.

(2) Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund's current fiscal period (March 1, 2021 through November 30, 2021) is calculated as the dollar value of distributions in the fiscal year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of November 30, 2021.

(3) The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period's distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of November 30, 2021.

(4) Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ending November 30, 2021. Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year including distributions paid and reinvested.

In order to comply with the requirements of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, each Fund will provide its shareholders of record on the record date with a 19(a) Notice disclosing the sources of its dividend payment when a distribution includes anything other than net investment income.

xiii If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then the second option applies.

xiv The full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity also has to be presented in the cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification as only then the market always gets the full picture of the group holdings. In case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.). Numbers shall be attributed to all persons or entities within the group in column 1 in order to allow a clear indication of the control structure in column 6. The names of all undertakings of the control chain shall be provided in column 2, even if the number of the directly held voting rights and/or financial instruments is not equal or higher than the notifiable threshold. Columns 3 & 4 shall indicate the holdings of those persons or entities directly holding the voting rights and/or financial instruments if the holding is equal or higher than the notifiable threshold.

xv The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held have to be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

It sees ResMed benefiting from increased industry device volume growth from 2023. ResMed can also capture more of the market for sleep-related devices over the medium-to-longer term even if rival Philips's device volumes return to pre-pandemic levels, Macquarie says. ""Together, we see this as presentingupside risk to consensus forecasts for ResMed device revenues and group earnings over the medium-longer term (+6% and +3%, respectively),"" says Macquarie, which rates ResMed at outperform.

Indeed, Carnival's website last week showed it offering 40% off cruise rates as part of a ""cyber week promotion,"" while Royal Caribbean 's webpage opened to an offer of ""30% off all guests,"" plus additional discounts.

Historically, once cruise lines have started discounting, it can take years to get back to pre-discounted levels. As Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio explained on a conference call last month, long periods of clawbacks have occurred ""time and time again."" He cautioned that some companies have still not recovered to pre-Great Recession yields more than a decade later. For that reason, he said Norwegian is ""fixated on pricing"" and would sacrifice short-term occupancy to preserve it.

Norwegian, which in contrast to Carnival and Royal Caribbean is skewed more toward the luxury market, is offering a cyber sale right now, but it is focused on onboard discounting, rather than discounted ticket prices. According to its website last week, Norwegian has been offering up to $4,250 in value for onboard activities like a free open bar, specialty dining, excursions, Wi-Fi, airfare for a second guest and even $250 to spend on a Norwegian cruise.

Mike Driscoll, editor of industry newsletter Cruise Week, says discounting for the first quarter of next year has been mild from luxury lines, climbing somewhat with premium lines and is very high among more mass-market brands. On the whole, he notes heavy discounting for the first half of next year is occurring at levels ""not seen since 2009."" In an article in Travel Weekly last month, Norwegian's Mr. Del Rio was quoted as referring to the low prices of some cruises as ""shocking.""

However, Mr. Driscoll said the second half of next year is already seeing solid pricing, up 5% to 7% compared with 2019, citing various retail sources, though he notes luxury lines are showing the greatest strength. Wall Street is modeling overall passenger ticket revenue growing mid-single digit percentages versus 2019 levels by the end of next year for Carnival and Royal Caribbean , but shows Norwegian's passenger ticket revenue growing 14% on that basis.

In an interview for this column, UBS analyst Robin Farley cautioned against applying recovery timelines from historical downturns to today's situation. Hotels, she points out, have seen a much healthier recovery recently than from a usual downturn, noting prices are back ahead of occupancy in that sector.

Relative to hotels, cruise-ship supply is limited. A spokesperson for Carnival said that because there have been only a limited number of yards building cruise ships each year around the world, there is a natural cap on supply growth. That means that, while there might be some near-term discounting, demand should exceed supply longer-term, providing for an environment for pricing stability. Indeed, in the years before the pandemic, occupancy rates for Carnival and Royal Caribbean consistently ran over 100%.

In his note last month, Truist's Patrick Scholes did say the past 20 months have been unlike anything the cruise industry has seen before, musing, ""perhaps this time will be different.""

Cruise operators are hoping so. But investors might need to see firmer evidence of a rapid pricing recovery before they dive in.

The question, for an industry that badly needs the sales after more than a year largely ashore, is whether today's discounts will weigh on cruise pricing longer term.

All three major cruise lines have recently voiced a focus on retaining ticket prices amid new Covid-19 variants. But as companies have been reintroducing ships back into the waters, they have had shorter timelines to sell near-term tickets. That has led to discounting to tempt people onboard in the coming months, especially as variants have proliferated and breakthrough infections in vaccinated consumers occur.",",RCL:XNYS,R1CL34:BVMF,RC8:XFRA,RCL:XMEX,0I1W:XLON,1NC:XFRA,NCLHN:XMEX,NCLH:XNYS,0UC3:XLON,NCLH:XWBO,N1CL34:BVMF,",1638716400004,",xdjgic,xdjtl,xft250,xgldow,xnyci,xr3000,xsp500,xussci,",,,,",RCL:XNYS,R1CL34:BVMF,RC8:XFRA,RCL:XMEX,0I1W:XLON,",NAMZ USA ,,1638698401000,1670308699579,Dow Jones Institutional News,en,",usa,namz,",,",122109430,122109430,",By Laura Forman ,",ubs,rccl,klstrs,crnivl,",DJDN,DJDN000020211205ehc50006o,727,",crnivl,crnivl,klstrs,klstrs,rccl,rccl,ubs,rccl,",",i74,iship,itsp,imarpas,",Cruise Pricing Risks Sailing Off the Deep End -- Heard on the Street,1638716400004,"Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",rep,article,"['RCL', 'NCLH']",,2021-12-05,1638716419508

That was much better than the 0.9% increase Wall Street had been expecting. Shoppers also kept buying more premium products and fresh produce, with the fresh department seeing higher growth compared with the total store.

More important, though, Kroger's gross margin excluding fuel sales fell by a milder-than-expected 41 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, compared with a year earlier, an improvement from the pace of profitability decline seen in the first two quarters. That, combined with better-than-expected sales and an upgraded guidance, sent Kroger shares up 11% on Thursday.

Prospects for the next quarter look good so far. Back-to-office attendance peaked in early November at 39% and has since fallen to roughly 32.5%, around where it was during the summer, according to data from Kastle. With Americans continuing to work from home, cold weather and uncertainty from the Omicron variant, there is more reason to suspect Americans will keep grocery aisles busy. Kroger itself expects same-store sales to decline by a more modest 0.2%-0.4% for the full fiscal year, compared with its previous expectation of an up-to-1.5% decline.

Kroger's margin improvement might seem, well, marginal, but profitability metrics matter a lot for the company, whose gross margins lag behind peers such as Albertsons, Ahold Delhaize, Sprouts Farmers Market and Walmart. Both Walmart and Target's share prices took a big hit after the retailers reported that margins shrank more than expected.

The company might have added a bit more to its bottom line if it hadn't made ""price investments,"" or cuts to prices to compete with the likes of Walmart. There is wisdom to this caution, though. Though the food-at-home trend looks sticky thus far, some of the top-line growth for grocers have also been driven by consumers' willingness to trade up to more premium brands. That may not be sustainable once consumers have burned through their stimulus-fueled savings.

Compared with peers such as Albertsons and Sprouts, which last year expanded their margins substantially, Kroger's margins look more sustainable. Kroger's gross margins grew by a modest 14 basis points last year compared with Albertsons' 55 basis points and Sprouts' 315 basis points, according to BMO Capital Markets estimates.

About 82% of consumers polled by Kroger's data-analytics team said they are feeling the impact of inflation and 25% of consumers said they aren't confident about their finances, he added.

The company said it is passing down costs to consumers where possible and is choosing to hold down prices in some areas. It is consulting its historical data to identify which items people are willing to pay up for.

Mr. McMullen said shoppers are still splurging in some cases and are looking for products with higher quality, even as those consumers search for ways to stretch their budgets. In response, the groceries chain said it is offering more personalized discounts, store brands and larger packs.

Kroger said its sales, excluding fuel, rose 3.1% at stores open at least 15 months from a year earlier, beating Wall Street expectations. Same-store sales rose 14% from two years ago.

The grocer also said net profit attributable to the company was $483 million, down from $631 million a year earlier. Earnings were 64 cents on a per-share basis, compared with 80 cents last year.

Kroger raised its adjusted earnings for the year to roughly $3.40 to $3.50 a share from $3.25 to $3.35 a share as it earlier projected.

Shares in Kroger rose 11% to $44.65 on Thursday. The stock is on pace for its largest percentage increase since Nov. 5, 2019, according to FactSet.

Kroger and other food retailers are recording lower profits, partly because they say they are spending more on sourcing and delivering products. Companies say they continue to wrestle with shortages of items such as pet food and beverages, and are spending more on freight, warehousing and labor to keep their shelves stocked.

Executives at Kroger said the company is using additional warehouse space. Packaged-food products are in shorter supply than fresh items and some manufacturers haven't brought back variety yet, they added. Merchandise costs, which include advertising, warehousing and transportation, rose 9% from last year to $25 billion.

Supply-chain challenges have improved slightly in recent weeks but haven't bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, industry executives say. Supermarket executives say they are securing food from a wider network of suppliers and storing more inventory to work ahead of supply issues.

These efforts are adding to overall costs in the U.S., fueling the highest inflation in three decades. Grocery prices rose 5.4% in October from a year earlier, with meat, poultry, fish and eggs increasing 12%. Pork prices climbed 14%, the highest annual increase since 1990. As meat prices remain high, consumers are switching to less costly types of meat or store brands. Retailers expect more shoppers to seek bargains in the coming months.

Still, consumer spending remains strong, executives say, and grocery sales are higher than they were before the pandemic, as people continue to work remotely and cook more at home.

Executives from Kroger, Walmart Inc. and other retailers met with President Biden earlier this week to discuss the supply chain. Also this week, the Federal Trade Commission said it is seeking information from grocers and retailers about how they are managing supply-chain challenges as the agency looks into higher prices and anticompetitive behavior.

A new Covid-19 variant is causing concern among supermarkets that rely on consumer-facing workers and are trying to keep up with steady demand. Some companies say they are waiting for more clarity on the Omicron variant before imposing significant changes and are also standing by to see how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's vaccine requirement will shake out. Many say they worry that either, or both, could worsen worker shortages.

PR Newswire

SANTA MONICA, Calif. and MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 3, 2021

SANTA MONICA, Calif. and MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Clearlake Capital Group, L.P . (together with certain of its affiliates, ""Clearlake"") today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to sell Provation, a provider of software and SaaS-based clinical productivity and workflow automation solutions for healthcare customers, to Fortive Corporation (""Fortive"") (NYSE: FTV). The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.

Clearlake invested in Provation in March 2018 through a carve-out acquisition from Wolters Kluwer and subsequently expanded the organization significantly. Under its ownership, Clearlake supported Provation and the management team across multiple growth initiatives. The Company launched new SaaS products for clinical productivity, care coordination and quality reporting, and continued to invest in engineering and products to sustain innovation while increasing sales & marketing resources to address the large and growing market. Additionally, the Company was able to successfully acquire and integrate four strategic and highly accretive add-on acquisitions including MD-Reports, ePreop, iProcedures and endoPRO. These complementary businesses bolstered Provation's scale and solutions offerings while also helping to diversify Provation into other specialities such as anesthesia and pulmonology, amongst others.

These initiatives resulted in accelerated organic revenue to double digit for the TTM period ended September 30, 2021 and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled during its three year partnership with Clearlake. Today, the Company has a global customer base of more than 5,000 health systems, hospitals, surgery centers and medical offices, and its solutions are used in 19 of the top 20 U.S. hospitals, according to the latest 2021-2022 U.S. News & World Report .

""We are delighted by the progress made by Daniel and the Provation team as the company has grown to become the premier provider of clinical documentation software and SaaS solutions. Clearlake's O.P.S.(R) framework helped Provation flourish under our ownership, to the benefit of clinicians, practitioners, and patients alike. We believe the sale to Fortive is an excellent outcome for all parties and we look forward to watching Provation's continued success,"" said Behdad Eghbali, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Clearlake, and Paul Huber , Principal at Clearlake.

""This is a very exciting day in the history of Provation. The strategic transformation and journey we've gone through in the past couple of years, with the guidance of Clearlake, has been tremendous and set us up for continued growth. We are exceptionally proud and grateful to Clearlake for the work we've done together,"" said Daniel Hamburger, CEO of Provation. ""We have an amazing customer base and as we continue to focus on serving them, Fortive will be the perfect home for us. Fortive's commitment to culture, growth, and operational discipline will allow us to continue delivering on our Purpose: to empower Providers to deliver quality healthcare for all.""

""Provation joining Fortive is a perfect outcome based on the alignment of our shared strategy to serve hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) with critical workflow solutions that ensure safe, efficient and timely delivery of quality healthcare. We are thrilled to have Provation join us as a key part of our Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment. Their reputation and commitment to customer service is renowned in our industry and we look forward to pairing their clinical workflow expertise with our operational and clinical service software businesses, "" said Jim Lico , Fortive President & CEO.

That, combined with better-than-expected sales and an upgraded guidance, sent Kroger shares up 11% after its earnings call.

Prospects for the next quarter look good so far. Back-to-office attendance peaked in early November at 39% and has since fallen to roughly 32.5%, around where it was during the summer, according to data from Kastle. With Americans continuing to work from home, cold weather and uncertainty from the Omicron variant, there is more reason to suspect Americans will keep grocery aisles busy. Kroger itself expects same-store sales to decline by a more modest 0.2%-0.4% for the full fiscal year, compared with its previous expectation of an up-to-1.5% decline.

Kroger's margin improvement might seem, well, marginal, but profitability metrics matter a lot for the company, whose gross margins lag behind peers such as Albertsons, Ahold Delhaize, Sprouts Farmers Market and Walmart. Both Walmart and Target's share prices took a big hit after the retailers reported that margins shrank more than expected.

The company might have added a bit more to its bottom line if it hadn't made so-called ""price investments,"" or cuts to prices to compete with the likes of Walmart. There is wisdom to this caution, though. Though the food-at-home trend looks sticky thus far, some of the top-line growth for grocers have also been driven by consumers' willingness to trade up to more premium brands. That may not be sustainable once consumers have burned through their stimulus-fueled savings.

Compared with peers such as Albertsons and Sprouts, which last year expanded their margins substantially, Kroger's margins look more sustainable. Kroger's gross margins grew by a modest 14 basis points last year compared with Albertsons' 55 basis points and Sprouts' 315 basis points, per BMO Capital Markets estimates. BMO analyst Kelly Bania noted in a report that grocers with ""disproportionate margin expansion"" could be exposed to more earnings risk in a price-sensitive environment.

Investors should no doubt keep an eye on Kroger's margins, but they should keep in mind that sometimes, less is more.

Fortive Corporation (""Fortive"") (NYSE: FTV) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Clearlake Capital Group, L.P . to acquire Provation Software, Inc.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this release also references a forward-looking outlook on ""adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Adjusted EPS),"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We have not reconciled such forward-looking outlook on adjusted diluted net earnings per share because any corresponding GAAP measure and the reconciliations thereto would require us to make estimates or assumptions about unidentified and unknown future acquisitions and similar adjustments during the relevant period. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures, but should instead be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measure used by Fortive in this release may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

Skechers representatives acknowledged that the board received Tremblant's letter and said the company was reviewing and discussing it internally and with the board.

Tremblant isn't the only shareholder that would like to see changes at Skechers. Another activist, Boston-based Changebridge Capital, which holds less than 1% of the stock, largely agrees with Tremblant, calling the share buyback a ""no-brainer."" The firm invested in the company in October, believing it to be ""very inexpensive with catalysts to grow.""

Changebridge also favors Skechers initiating a dividend, noting that it has ample ability to do so. ""With a dividend, the total return would be less volatile,"" Changebridge Chief Financial Officer Ross Klein tells Barron's. As Skechers knows, appearances matter.

Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A-' ratings to Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc .'s (Marsh) two new senior unsecured notes issuances. The company issued a $400 million note (2.375%) maturing in December 2031 and a $350 million note (2.90%) maturing in December 2051. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of a $500 million note maturing in January 2022. Fitch's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Marsh remains at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Key Rating Drivers

Top-Tier Competitive Position: Marsh's market position is a source of strength, with diverse worldwide operations in insurance/reinsurance brokerage, HR and employee benefits consulting and management consulting. The company is often cited as the largest insurance broker globally. Marsh's acquisition of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (JLT) created a larger, even more diverse entity with complimentary operating franchises in specialty insurance and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting services. The merger also expanded Marsh's international profile through JLT's presence in the UK, Asia and other emerging markets.

Leverage Improving: Fitch is encouraged by healthy cash flow generation during 2020 and de-leveraging initiatives following the company's acquisition of JLT. The $6.4 billion JLT acquisition materially increased leverage to the high-2.0x/3.0x range, but the company has reduced leverage to the low-2.0x range via EBITDA growth and debt reduction. Fitch believes Marsh's gross leverage could be 2.0x-2.25x in the next few years or higher than the mid-1.0x range from recent years.

Stable Business Model: Marsh operates a fairly predictable business model in an industry that performed well throughout the economic cycle. The consulting segment (Mercer + Oliver Wyman ) exhibited more meaningful cyclicality historically, but this is balanced against the more stable insurance segment that only declined 1% organically in 2009. Marsh's business is characterized by high client retention and solid organic growth. The company's revenue and earnings are well diversified by customers and geographies, with the U.S. representing the largest concentration at 47% of revenue. The company is also meaningfully diversified by types of services offered.

Coronavirus Impact Muted: Marsh performed reasonably well during the coronavirus pandemic to date, and Fitch projects this to continue despite considerable uncertainties created by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic. Revenue grew 10% organically YTD through September and 1% in 2020, with bigger impacts from the economic slowdown felt in the consulting segment. Profitability improved meaningfully during 2021 and 2020 driven by coronavirus-related cost savings and additional integration from the 2019 JLT acquisition. Marsh continues to face considerable uncertainties created by the global pandemic, although its business model has proven resilient.

Strong Financial Flexibility: Fitch views Marsh's liquidity position as a credit positive with respect to the overall IDR. Marsh has material liquidity supported by its cash position that has historically been near $1 billion or higher, strong and stable cash flow generation and various sources of debt financing. The company had $1.4 billion of cash at September 2021. Marsh generated post-dividend FCF in excess of $2.0 billion in 2020 and $1.1 billion YTD through September 2021 despite challenging global market conditions.

Derivation Summary

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc .'s ratings reflect its strong competitive position in the insurance brokerage and consulting industries, successful growth track record, reasonable financial leverage, significant financial flexibility, and historically strong cash generation.

Marsh is the largest global insurance broker by revenue. It is materially larger in terms of revenue and EBITDA than many of its industry peers such as Arthur J. Gallagher & Co . (BBB/Stable) and Willis Towers Watson PLC (BBB/Stable). It is also larger than Aon plc (BBB+/Stable) and historically managed its balance sheet with lower leverage in the low/mid-1.0x range, prior to its 2019 JLT acquisition. Fitch believes the company's market leading share position, solid margins, and moderate leverage position the rating well at the 'A-' rating category relative to Fitch-rated peers.

Key Assumptions

Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer

--Organic revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range over the next few years with incremental contribution from M&A;

--EBITDA margins remain relatively consistent with 2020 levels in the mid to high-20% range, with incremental flow-through from revenue growth offset by higher expenses in the next couple of years;

--Capital Allocation: uses of cash split between M&A, dividends and share repurchases;

--Debt/Leverage: remains in the low-2.0x range in the next few years.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:

--Gross leverage, Fitch-defined as total debt with equity credit/operating EBITDA, expected to be sustained near 1.7x or below;

--Interest coverage sustained above 12.0x;

--Material improvements to operating fundamentals, including revenue growth or EBITDA/FCF margins, could also lead Fitch to reassess the rating.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:

--Gross leverage expected to be sustained above 2.25x;

--Interest coverage expected to remain below 10x;

--A material change in strategy and/or deterioration of financial profile or operating performance.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579 .

Liquidity and Debt Structure

Strong Liquidity Profile: Marsh has strong and stable access to various sources of liquidity to support its organic growth, M&A initiatives and shareholder returns. Key sources of liquidity include:

--Balance sheet cash that consistently exceeded $1 billion over the past several years ($1.4 billion at September 2021);

--Post-dividend FCF generation that ranged from roughly $400 million to $2.1 billion per year since 2011;

--An undrawn $2.8 billion multi-currency unsecured revolver;

--A $2.0 billion commercial paper program;

--Various additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks.

Debt Structure: Marsh is a seasoned investment-grade issuer with a well-staggered maturity profile, various sources of debt capital and a long track record of managing a relatively conservative balance sheet. Leverage increased meaningfully from 1.0x-2.0x prior to 2019 to more than 3.0x following the April 2019 JLT acquisition. However, the company has since focused on reducing leverage via a combination of higher EBITDA and debt reductions.

Marsh had approximately $10.7 billion of debt outstanding at September 2021, which was predominantly in senior unsecured notes with staggered maturities ranging from 2022 through 2051 (rates from 1.349%-5.875%). The company also has a $2.8 billion multi-currency unsecured revolver (undrawn) and a $2.0 billion commercial paper program in place.

Copyright © 2021 by Fitch Ratings, Inc ., Fitch Ratings Ltd . and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001

Fitch Ratings, Inc . is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the ""NRSRO""). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory  ), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the ""non-NRSROs"") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.

Disclosures

Funds within Goldman Sachs ETF Trust

Fund shares are not individually redeemable and are issued and redeemed by a Fund at their net asset value (""NAV"") only in large, specified blocks of shares called creation units. Shares otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading at market price (not NAV). Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC , Member FINRA

Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund

Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value (""NAV""), which may increase investors' risk of loss. At the time of sale, an investor's shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the original investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ from investments in common stock, including among others risks related to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks and trading risks.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. The Fund has completed its initial public offering. Investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and risk tolerance before investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors, and the Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program. Investors should carefully review and consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses before investing.

Opening Call:

Stock futures wobbled, while oil prices continued to rise after OPEC and a group of Russia-led oil producers agreed to continue pumping more crude.

Investors are grappling with the unclear impact of Omicron for the global economy. The variant has triggered fresh restrictions around the world, throwing up new obstacles to overseas travel just as it was starting to bounce back from last year's Covid-19 measures. Scientists are trying to gauge how effective current vaccines will be against the variant.

""What we see now this week since we had the Omicron news is extremely high volatility and extreme nervousness in markets,"" said Carsten Brzeski , ING Groep 's global head of macro research. He expects this to continue until more is known about Omicron.

Brent crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets rose after OPEC and a group of Russia-led oil producers agreed Thursday to continue pumping more crude, betting that pent-up demand in a post-lockdown world would outweigh any hit to economic activity from the recent Covid-19 permutations.

But the group said its session would remain open, a technical move that would allow it to reconvene quickly and change course if the Covid-19 situation changes dramatically.

Investors are awaiting data at 8:30 a.m. ET on how many jobs U.S. employers added in November. Employers say they are eager to hire from a depleted pool of workers, leading to increased bargaining power and rising wages for many employees.

A strong rebound in the labor market could impact the Federal Reserve 's timeline for paring back some of its monetary policy support that has supported asset prices.

""After a week of mixed macro news, some stronger news would be good for the market,"" Mr. Brzeski said.

Stocks to Watch:

Shares of DocuSign were sinking in premarket trading Friday after the e-signature software company issued a fourth-quarter forecast that missed estimates.

Analysts at Citigroup said DocuSign ""delivered one of the biggest [Software as a Service] whiffs in recent memory.""

The company said it expects revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 31, of $557 million to $563 million, below analysts' expectations of $573.8 million. DocuSign expects fourth-quarter billings of $647 million to $659 million. Analysts were forecasting fourth-quarter billings of $705.4 million, according to FactSet.

Tesla's China business is recalling 21,599 locally made Model Ys due to issues with auto parts from suppliers.

The company has filed the recall plans with China's top market regulator, according to a notice posted Friday by an affiliate of the State Administration for Market Regulation.

A component known as a steering knuckle, which allows the wheels to turn, might be deformed or break while the car is in use, increasing the risk that an accident could occur, the notice said.

Tesla Shanghai will carry out related checks on the affected vehicles for free and replace substandard steering knuckles, the regulator said.

The recall, which affects vehicles manufactured between Feb. 4 and Oct. 30, isn't the first time the company has had to deal with safety issues in the world's largest auto market.

Forex:

The dollar could receive a further boost from U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, particularly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this week that inflation no longer looks transitory, ING said.

Strong data would add to the view that the Fed could remove monetary stimulus more quickly, it said.

""Any sharper than expected drop in the unemployment rate (3.8% has been suggested as a metric for full employment and the start of tightening) or sharper rise in average hourly earnings (e.g. more than 0.4% month-on-month) could drive the dollar higher today.""

The consensus in a WSJ poll is for nonfarm payrolls to rise by 573,000 and an unemployment rate of 4.5%.

The Turkish lira fell after ratings agency Fitch downgraded the country's outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable"" and following data that showed inflation accelerated.

Fitch said premature interest rate cuts and the prospect of further easing have weakened domestic confidence, reflected in the lira's sharp depreciation and rising inflation, which create risks to macroeconomic and financial stability and could re-ignite external financing pressures.

Data on Friday showed consumer prices jumped 21.31% year-on-year in November after rising 19.89% in October.

With no signs President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will permit large rate rises, the lira will struggle to recover and inflation will remain very high through most of the next six-to-nine months, Capital Economics economist Jason Tuvey said.

Bonds:

In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.446% from 1.447% Thursday.

Within a year, the monetary policy environment changed from ""QE infinity"" and ""lower interest rates for longer"" to one characterized by a global, generalized and rapid rise in interest rates, said Gergely Majoros, member of Carmignac's investment committee.

With this backdrop, Carmignac remains ""very cautious"" on core sovereign bonds and very selective in corporate bonds, while it sees value niches in emerging-market bonds and equity markets, he said.

Majoros said that in an environment where inflation should persist longer, Carmignac's risk management focuses on an active management of duration exposure, cash and short-term instruments which are the most suited in episodes of volatility, and the USD given its safe-haven status and dynamics.

Pimco maintains a positive view on spread securities from the eurozone periphery, especially Italy, while focusing on receiving adequate compensation for policy uncertainty, Konstantin Veit, portfolio manager and head of European rates, said.

Given the euro area's unique institutional structure and uneven macroeconomic conditions, Pimco expects yields in the region to remain relatively more anchored than elsewhere in the world, and Pimco therefore is positioned rather independently from benchmark indexes with a view to overall duration, he said.

""While starting valuations offer limited room for spread tightening and the macroeconomic outlook remains highly risky, a less crisis-prone euro area generally bodes well for risky assets,"" he said.

Commodities:

Brent crude oil rose after OPEC+ pressed ahead with plans to raise oil production by 400,000 barrels a day in January despite the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant and the recent move by oil consuming nations to tap strategic reserves.

Prices fell after the decision on Thursday but then rebounded on the day and continue higher Friday.

Goldman Sachs 's Damien Courvalin points to the alliance's promise to immediately adjust their plans should the situation require it. Similarly, while OPEC+ will raise production in January, the small increase exacerbates ""the long-term deficit...[and] we believe current price levels offer compelling opportunities to reposition for the ongoing structural bull market,"" he added.

London gold prices were flat, with the selloff in the precious metal appearing to lose steam. The prospect of the Fed tapering its asset-buying program has boosted the U.S. dollar this week, putting pressure on gold.

That is despite the rising risk aversion and asset selloffs that have come with the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, said Oanda's Jeffrey Halley .

LME three-month copper futures were, after gentle losses on Thursday, with most metals prices moving higher as well.

Asia-Pacific Nations Use Tougher Tactics to Combat Omicron Variant

Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are creating tougher rules for those infected with the Omicron Covid-19 variant, as governments move more aggressively than they have against all other previous iterations, including Delta.

Omicron's Severity Will Take More Time to Assess, Doctors Say

JOHANNESBURG-It is still too early to tell whether Covid-19 caused by the new Omicron variant is milder or more severe than that from other strains of the coronavirus, doctors tracking a rapidly growing outbreak in South Africa said Friday.

The country, which has more known Omicron cases than any other, is likely to be the first to deliver answers to the questions doctors and scientists have been grappling with since the World Health Organization declared the new strain a ""variant of concern"" a week ago. Key among those are whether Omicron makes those infected sicker, whether it is more transmissible and in how far current Covid-19 vaccines or a past infection protect against the variant.

The effort would also see participating nations share information on sensitive technologies used against political dissidents, journalists, foreign government officials and human rights activists, administration officials said. 


   
 
 

Biden Administration Issues Cybersecurity Directives for Freight and Passenger Rail

WASHINGTON-Nearly all U.S. freight and passenger rail systems will be required to report certain cybersecurity incidents to the Department of Homeland Security within 24 hours of discovery under new directives published Thursday by the Biden administration.

The orders, issued under congressional authority given to the Transportation Security Administration , will affect about 90% of passenger rail systems in the U.S. and 80% of freight rail systems that are considered ""higher risk,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security official said, meaning they are considered vital to economic and national security. 


   
 
 

Senate Approves Spending Bill Averting Government Shutdown

WASHINGTON-Congress passed a short-term extension of government funding and sent the legislation to President Biden's desk, averting a partial shutdown after resolving a standoff over vaccine rules.

Top Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement on the spending plan Thursday morning to extend funding through Feb. 18, then quickly maneuvered the legislation through both the House and Senate before the expiration of current funding at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The legislation also includes $7 billion for assisting evacuees from Afghanistan.

MCDONALD'S CORP.

MCD +0.4%

A long-running scandal is no longer on the front burner at McDonald's. Former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook agreed to return compensation now valued at more than $105 million to resolve a legal dispute related to his dismissal as head of the burger chain, the company said Thursday. The settlement, which avoids a trial against the former top executive, included an apology from Mr. Easterbook, who was dismissed in November 2019 when he acknowledged having a consensual relationship with an unnamed employee, McDonald's said. Shares of McDonald's rose 0.4% Thursday.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON

JNJ -2.8%

U.S. vaccine advisers recommended adults take a Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. or Moderna Inc. over J&J's after health authorities said the rate of a rare but serious blood-clotting condition was higher than previously detected. The position is likely to deal another blow to the use of the J&J shot, whose uptake had been hurt by manufacturing issues and earlier reports of the blood-clotting condition. J&J shares fell 2.8% Friday.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPM -0.7%

A big proponent of in-person meetings decided to go virtual at one of its premier annual events. On Wednesday, JPMorgan told participants in its upcoming San Francisco healthcare conference that the spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 had made gathering too risky. The bank earlier told companies it wasn't going to allow virtual presentations, and that anyone looking to be a part of the conference would have to attend in person. The decision came after several biotechnology companies pulled out of planned in-person appearances. JPMorgan's shares dropped 0.7% Wednesday.

TESLA INC.

TSLA +1.8%

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Sen. Elizabeth Warren clashed with one another on Twitter after the senator called on the billionaire electric-vehicle producer to pay more taxes. ""Let's change the rigged tax code so The Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else,"" Ms. Warren tweeted, referring to Mr. Musk, who this week was named Time magazine's person of the year. Mr. Musk responded with a string of tweets, saying that he will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. Tesla shares rose 1.8% Wednesday.

TOYOTA MOTOR CORP.

TM +2.7%

A prominent voice of caution about electric vehicles is reversing its views. Toyota said Tuesday that it would make 3.5 million EVs a year by 2030 and set a target of selling 4 million annually. Toyota had been the last of the world's top auto makers to express caution about such a transition, and even this week it said many customers -- especially in the U.S. outside the coasts -- weren't yet ready for a battery-powered car. By 2030, it said it wants all models in its upscale Lexus brand to be electric in the U.S., China and Europe. Shares of Toyota rose 2.7% Tuesday.

KROGER CO.

KR -0.1%

A big grocer is bagging some Covid-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees. Kroger told workers that it would no longer provide two weeks of paid emergency leave for unvaccinated employees who contract the virus unless local jurisdictions require otherwise, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kroger will also add a $50 monthly surcharge to company health plans for unvaccinated managers and other nonunion employees. Both policies are effective Jan. 1, according to a memo viewed by the Journal. Its shares dropped 0.1% Tuesday.

A long-running scandal is no longer on the front burner at McDonald's. Former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook agreed to return compensation now valued at more than $105 million to resolve a legal dispute related to his dismissal as head of the burger chain, the company said Thursday.

The settlement, which avoids a trial against the former top executive, included an apology from Mr. Easterbook who said he ""failed at times to uphold McDonald's values and fulfill certain of my responsibilities as a leader of the company."" He was dismissed in November 2019 when he acknowledged having a consensual relationship with an unnamed employee, McDonald's said. Shares of McDonald's rose 0.4% Thursday.

The electric-vehicle chief responded with a string of tweets, saying that he will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. ""Don't spend it all at once...oh wait you did already,"" he wrote Tuesday evening. ""You remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason,"" Mr. Musk said. Tesla shares rose 1.8% Wednesday.

Toyota Motor Corp.

A prominent voice of caution about electric vehicles is reversing its views. Toyota said Tuesday that it would make 3.5 million EVs a year by 2030 and set a target of selling 4 million annually. Toyota had been the last of the world's top auto makers to express hesitation about such a transition, and even this week it said many of customers, especially in the U.S. outside the coasts, weren't yet ready for a battery-powered car and might not be for some time.

By 2030, it said it wants all models in its upscale Lexus brand to be electric in the U.S., China and Europe. This week it showed off more than a dozen of the 30 EV models it intends to have on sale by that year. Shares of Toyota rose 2.7% Tuesday.

Kroger Co.

A big grocer is bagging some Covid-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees. Kroger told workers it would no longer provide two weeks of paid emergency leave for unvaccinated employees who contract the virus unless local jurisdictions require otherwise, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kroger will also add a $50 monthly surcharge to company health plans for unvaccinated managers and other nonunion employees, according to a memo viewed by the Journal.

Both policies are effective Jan. 1, the memo said. Kroger is one of the biggest employers in the U.S., with almost half a million full-time and part-time employees. Its shares dropped 0.1% Tuesday.

The terms and conditions of the Offers and the Consent Solicitations are described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated December 6, 2021 (the ""Offer to Purchase""), previously distributed to holders of the Notes.

Newmont has been advised that as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 17, 2021 (such date and time, the ""Early Tender Deadline""), (i) $89,459,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Newmont Notes had been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Newmont Notes Offer and delivered consents pursuant to the Newmont Notes Consent Solicitation, representing approximately 28% of the outstanding Newmont Notes, and (ii) $4,003,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Goldcorp Notes had been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Goldcorp Notes Tender Offer and delivered consents pursuant to the Goldcorp Notes Consent Solicitation, representing approximately 4% of the outstanding Goldcorp Notes. Newmont intends to purchase all Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline on December 20, 2021 or as promptly as practicable thereafter (the ""Early Settlement Date"").

Newmont has not obtained the Requisite Consents for the execution of supplemental indentures to amend the applicable indentures governing the Notes, as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. Accordingly, supplemental indentures to the applicable indentures governing the Notes will not be executed. Any Notes not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offers will remain outstanding and will be governed by the terms of the applicable indentures governing the Notes.

Holders who validly tendered (and did not validly withdraw) their Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration (the ""Total Consideration"") for such series of Notes, which includes an early tender payment of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes of such series validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer (the ""Early Tender Payment""). Holders who validly tendered (and did not validly withdraw) Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will receive the Total Consideration equal to (i) $1,037.27 per $1,000 principal amount of Newmont Notes and (ii) $1,037.27 per $1,000 principal amount of Goldcorp Notes, in each case, as calculated in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase. In addition to the applicable Total Consideration for such series of Notes, holders of Notes of such series accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer will receive accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer from and including the most recent interest payment date to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date.

Holders of Notes of each series who have not yet tendered their Notes of such series have until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on January 4, 2022 (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the ""Expiration Time""), to tender their Notes pursuant to the applicable Offer. Holders of the Notes who validly tender their Notes following the Early Tender Deadline, but on or prior to the Expiration Time, will be eligible to receive the applicable ""Tender Offer Consideration"" for such series of Notes, which is an amount equal to the applicable Total Consideration less the applicable Early Tender Payment. In addition to the applicable Tender Offer Consideration for such series of Notes, holders of Notes of such series accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer will receive accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer from and including the most recent interest payment date to, but excluding, the final settlement date.

Newmont's obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, the Notes that are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Newmont of certain conditions to the Offers set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the issuance and sale of debt securities by Newmont on terms satisfactory to Newmont that will generate net proceeds in an amount that is sufficient to finance the purchase of the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase on or prior to the Early Settlement Date.

Notes that are not tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will remain obligations of Newmont or Goldcorp, as applicable. There is no requirement in the indentures governing the Notes or otherwise that Newmont or Goldcorp redeem any Notes, and unless redeemed, such Notes will continue to remain outstanding. Newmont and Goldcorp currently intend to send a notice of redemption to redeem any Notes that remain outstanding after the Early Settlement Date.

This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption under the optional redemption provisions of the Indentures. Any notice of redemption of the Notes will be delivered pursuant to separate notices of redemption delivered in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture.

The complete terms and conditions of the Offers and Consent Solicitations are set forth in the Offer to Purchase that has been sent to holders of the Notes.

Morgan Securities LLC are acting as Dealer Managers for the Offers and Solicitation Agents for the Consent Solicitations.

",",neqac,c333,c33,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,",,1639883103000,"YouTube TV subscribers lost access to a basketball game in progress between the Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves. When the game cut out suddenly, some fans took to Twitter to complain about it.

""We've been in ongoing negotiations with Google's YouTube TV and unfortunately, they have declined to reach a fair deal with us based on market terms and conditions. As a result, their subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of networks,"" a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort.""

The companies are fighting over distribution fees for the Disney channels. A sticking point is YouTube TV's request for a clause that would guarantee it pays the same rate as distributors of a similar size, according to people familiar with the matter.

""We've held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we've been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired, and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV,"" a YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We know this is frustrating news for our customers, and not what we wanted. We will continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.""

Although YouTube TV doesn't disclose the number of subscribers, a person close to the company said it is more than four million. Its subscriber count tops the traditional pay-TV providers Altice USA Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., according to data from MoffettNathanson.

YouTube TV carries more than a dozen Disney channels, plus local broadcast channels. The loss removes a sizable chunk of YouTube TV's offering. YouTube TV said it would drop its monthly subscription price to $49.99 from $64.99 as long as the channels are unavailable.

The impasse between the programmer and distributor spilled out into the public earlier this week when YouTube began to notify subscribers that they could soon lose access to Disney's programming. YouTube TV also took the unusual step of encouraging subscribers to purchase a subscription to Disney's streaming services such as Disney+ and ESPN+ to regain access to some of the content they would lose.

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are global financial services institutions that served as prime brokers for Archegos Capital Management (""Archegos""), a family office with $10 billion under management. Recently, class action complaints were filed against Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for allegedly selling large amounts of shares on or about March 25, 2021, based upon material, non-public information about Archegos and its need to fully liquidate its stock positions because of margin call pressure. As a result of these sales, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley avoided billions in losses.

Specifically, Johnson Fistel 's investigation seeks to determine whether Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may be held liable to purchasers of the common stock of the following companies, between March 22, 2021 and March 29, 2021, for their investment losses:

YouTube TV Loses Disney Channels Including ESPN in Standoff


By Lillian Rizzo and Patience Haggin 

YouTube TV subscribers lost access to channels including ESPN and FX after YouTube's agreement to carry programming from Walt Disney Co. expired Saturday.

The standoff pits Google's YouTube TV, which streams a package of channels to consumers, against Disney, parent of the ABC broadcasting network and more than a dozen cable channels including Disney Channel and Freeform. Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc.

The companies are fighting over distribution fees for the Disney channels. A sticking point is YouTube TV's request for a clause that would guarantee it pays the same rate as distributors of a similar size, according to people familiar with the matter.

Although YouTube TV doesn't disclose the number of subscribers, a person close to the company said it is more than four million. Its subscriber count tops the traditional pay-TV providers Altice USA Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., according to data from MoffettNathanson.

YouTube TV carries more than a dozen Disney channels, plus local broadcast channels. The loss removes a sizable chunk of YouTube TV's offering. YouTube TV said it would drop its monthly subscription price to $49.99 from $64.99 as long as the channels are unavailable.

The impasse between the programmer and distributor spilled out into the public earlier this week when YouTube began to notify subscribers that they could soon lose access to Disney's programming. YouTube TV also took the unusual step of encouraging subscribers to purchase a subscription to Disney's streaming services such as Disney+ and ESPN+ to regain access to some of the content they would lose.

The line between beer and soda is about to get blurrier. Anheuser-Busch said Thursday that it is introducing a line of Bud Light-branded hard soda in cola, cherry cola, orange and lemon-lime flavors. PepsiCo Inc. early next year will also roll out an alcoholic version of Mountain Dew in a partnership with Boston Beer Co.

These rollouts follow Coca-Cola Co.'s introduction of a boozy version of Topo Chico sparkling water with Molson Coors Beverage Co. The product launches are the latest in a series of crossover ventures as alcohol and soft-drink companies push into one another's turf. Shares of Anheuser-Busch rose 2.5% Thursday.

McDonald's Corp.

A long-running scandal is no longer on the front burner at McDonald's. Former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook agreed to return compensation now valued at more than $105 million to resolve a legal dispute related to his dismissal as head of the burger chain, the company said Thursday.

The settlement, which avoids a trial against the former top executive, included an apology from Mr. Easterbook who said he ""failed at times to uphold McDonald's values and fulfill certain of my responsibilities as a leader of the company."" He was dismissed in November 2019 when he acknowledged having a consensual relationship with an unnamed employee, McDonald's said. Shares of McDonald's rose 0.4% Thursday.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.

A big proponent of in-person meetings decided to go virtual at one of its premier annual events. On Wednesday, JPMorgan told participants in approaching San Francisco healthcare conference that the spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 had made gathering in person too risky. The bank had earlier told companies it wasn't going to allow virtual presentations at the January gathering, and that anyone looking to be a part of the conference -- which typically draws thousands of people -- would have to attend in person.

The bank's decision came after several biotechnology companies pulled out of planned in-person appearances. JPMorgan's shares dropped 0.7% Wednesday.

Tesla Inc.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) clashed on Twitter after the lawmaker called on the billionaire to pay more taxes.

""Let's change the rigged tax code so The Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else,"" Ms. Warren tweeted, referring to Mr. Musk, whom Time magazine named its person of the year this week.

The electric-vehicle chief responded with a string of tweets, saying that he will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. ""Don't spend it all at once...oh wait you did already,"" he wrote Tuesday evening. ""You remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason,"" Mr. Musk said. Tesla shares rose 1.8% Wednesday.

Toyota Motor Corp.

A prominent voice of caution about electric vehicles is reversing its views. Toyota said Tuesday that it would make 3.5 million EVs a year by 2030 and set a target of selling 4 million annually. Toyota had been the last of the world's top auto makers to express hesitation about such a transition, and even this week it said many of customers, especially in the U.S. outside the coasts, weren't yet ready for a battery-powered car and might not be for some time.

By 2030, it said it wants all models in its upscale Lexus brand to be electric in the U.S., China and Europe. This week it showed off more than a dozen of the 30 EV models it intends to have on sale by that year. Shares of Toyota rose 2.7% Tuesday.

Kroger Co.

A big grocer is bagging some Covid-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees. Kroger told workers it would no longer provide two weeks of paid emergency leave for unvaccinated employees who contract the virus unless local jurisdictions require otherwise, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kroger will also add a $50 monthly surcharge to company health plans for unvaccinated managers and other nonunion employees, according to a memo viewed by the Journal.

Both policies are effective Jan. 1, the memo said. Kroger is one of the biggest employers in the U.S., with almost half a million full-time and part-time employees. Its shares dropped 0.1% Tuesday.

Press Release: Brown-Forman  Delivers Strong Net Sales Results and Raises Full Year Outlook

Brown-Forman Delivers Strong Net Sales Results and Raises Full Year Outlook 


LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 08, 2021-- 

Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE: BFA, BFB) announced financial results for its second quarter and first half of fiscal 2022. For the second quarter, the company's net sales(1) of $994 million increased 1% (+7% on an underlying basis(2) ) compared to the same prior-year period. In the quarter, operating income decreased 2% to $322 million (+10% on an underlying basis) and diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.49.

For the first six months of the fiscal year, the company's net sales increased 9% to $1,900 million (+12% on an underlying basis) compared to the same prior-year period. In the first half, operating income decreased 15% to $611 million (+13% on an underlying basis) and diluted earnings per share declined 24% to $0.89 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Canadian Mist, Early Times, and Collingwood brands in the prior year.

""Despite the many challenges and ongoing uncertainties created by the pandemic, Brown-Forman 's business remains incredibly strong,"" said Lawson Whiting , Brown-Forman's President and Chief Executive Officer. Whiting added, ""We are pleased with the strong first half of the fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth, particularly given consumers' increasing preference for premium spirits and our strength in the growing American whiskey and tequila categories.""

First Half of Fiscal 2022 Highlights 


   -- Net sales grew 9% (+12% underlying) 
 
          -- Developed international, emerging markets, and the Travel Retail3 
             channel delivered strong double-digit net sales growth. 
 
          -- Net sales in the United States were flat (+6% underlying). 
 
          -- Jack Daniel's family of brands net sales grew 9% (+11% underlying) 
             powered by 14% net sales growth (+15% underlying) from Jack 
             Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. 
 
          -- Premium bourbons grew net sales 11% (+18% underlying) driven by 
             sustained double-digit growth from Woodford Reserve and Old 
             Forester. 
 
          -- The tequila portfolio grew net sales 16% (+16% underlying) led by 
             double-digit growth from Herradura and el Jimador. 
 
   -- Strong free cash flow2 generation of $302 million, a 19% increase 
      compared to the prior-year period. 

First Half of Fiscal 2022 Brand Results 


   -- Jack Daniel's family of brands net sales growth was led by Jack Daniel's 
      Tennessee Whiskey, which benefited from higher volumes globally and 
      favorable channel mix in the United States related to the on-premise 
      reopening. Further contributions to net sales growth were driven by 
      higher volumes for Jack Daniel's RTDs and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, 
      as well as the ongoing international launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee 
      Apple. Supply chain disruptions adversely impacted these gains during the 
      first half of the fiscal year. 
   -- Premium bourbons, led by Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, maintained 
      double-digit net sales growth fueled by strong volumetric gains in the 
      United States and Travel Retail despite supply chain disruptions. 
   -- The tequila portfolio was propelled by double-digit net sales growth for 
      Herradura and el Jimador. Herradura grew volumes in the United States 
      along with Mexico, which cycled against a weaker prior-year base. el 
      Jimador's net sales growth was driven by broad-based volume gains in the 
      United States, Latin America, and the United Kingdom. These gains were 
      partially offset by lower volumes of New Mix in Mexico reflecting a 
      difficult prior-year comparison when volume benefited from a temporary 
      supply chain disruption in the beer industry. 

First Half of Fiscal 2022 Market Results 


   -- In the United States3, strong net sales growth was primarily driven by 
      Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, premium bourbons, and tequilas. Jack 
      Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey benefited from higher volumes and favorable 
      mix shift reflecting growth in the on-premise channel. These results were 
      largely offset by supply chain disruptions, the effect of acquisitions 
      and divestitures, and lower volumes in the off-premise channel driven by 
      a strong prior-year comparison. 
   -- Double-digit net sales growth in developed international3 markets was 
      driven by broad-based growth led by Germany, the United Kingdom, Korea, 
      and Spain. 
   -- The company's emerging markets3 registered double-digit net sales growth 
      propelled by volume gains across most markets largely driven by favorable 
      comparisons prior-year comparisons. Supply chain disruptions had an 
      adverse impact on results. 
   -- Net sales in the Travel Retail3 channel increased primarily due to a 
      favorable prior-year comparison, which was significantly impacted by 
      COVID-19 related travel bans and restrictions. 

First Half of Fiscal 2022 Other P&L Items 


   -- Company-wide price/mix driven by the favorable mix effects of faster 
      growth from our higher-priced brands and shift to the on-premise channel, 
      particularly in the United States, contributed 10 percentage points to 
      underlying net sales growth. Volumetric growth driven by our American 
      whiskeys contributed two percentage points to underlying net sales growth 
      was partially offset by lower volumes of New Mix and temporary supply 
      chain constraints. 
   -- Gross profit increased 9% (+12% underlying). Gross margins contracted 
      slightly to 60.1% driven primarily by unfavorable cost/mix, largely 
      offset by impact of the sale of the Canadian Mist, Early Times, and 
      Collingwood brands in the prior year. 
   -- The company's investment in advertising increased 24% (+23% underlying) 
      as the company cycled against a substantial reduction in promotional 
      activity during the same period last year due to COVID-19. 
   -- Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% (+8% 
      underlying) reflecting the timing of higher compensation-related expenses, 
      an increase in non-income tax reserves, and cycling against lower 
      discretionary spend in the prior-year period. 
   -- Operating income decreased 15% (+13% underlying), while diluted earnings 
      per share decreased 24% to $0.89, primarily driven by the $0.19 per share 
      impact from the gain on the sale of the Canadian Mist, Early Times, and 
      Collingwood brands in the prior year. 

First Half of Fiscal 2022 Financial Stewardship 


   -- On November 18, 2021, Brown-Forman 's Board of Directors approved a 5% 
      increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.1885 per share on 
      the Class A and Class B common stock. The quarterly cash dividend is 
      payable on December 28, 2021, to stockholders of record on December 3, 
      2021. This marked the company's 78th year of paying consecutive dividends 
      and the 38th year of increases in its regular quarterly dividend. 
   -- Brown-Forman 's Board of Directors also declared a special dividend of 
      approximately $480 million, or $1.00 per share, on its Class A and Class 
      B common stock. This special cash dividend is payable on December 29, 
      2021, to stockholders of record on December 9, 2021. 

Fiscal 2022 Outlook 


   -- Net sales. While volatility and uncertainty persists in the operating 
      environment due to COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions, we remain 
      confident in our growth momentum and have revised our full year outlook 
      from mid-single digit growth to high-single digit growth. Currently, we 
      are managing through the impact of global supply chain disruptions, 
      including glass supply, and have deployed a number of risk mitigation 
      strategies to address the various constraints on our business. While we 
      expect supply chain disruptions to persist throughout the fiscal year, we 
      believe the impact will become less significant in the second half of the 
      year. 
   -- Gross margin. We continue to expect gross margin to be flat or slightly 
      down for the full year compared to fiscal 2021, reflecting the 
      unfavorable impacts of supply chain disruptions, higher input costs 
      related to commodity prices, and higher transportation costs. The revised 
      outlook also reflects the modest positive impact of the January 1, 2022 
      suspension of tariffs on American whiskey exports to the European Union . 
   -- Gross margin. We continue to expect gross margin to be flat or slightly 
      down for the full year compared to fiscal 2021, reflecting the 
      unfavorable impacts of supply chain disruptions, higher input costs 
      related to commodity prices, and higher transportation costs. The outlook 
      reflects the modest positive impact of the January 1, 2022 suspension of 
      tariffs on American whiskey exports to the European Union . 
   -- Operating expenses. Considering the revised underlying net sales outlook 
      and our intent to align advertising investment growth with underlying net 
      sales growth, we have revised our underlying operating expense 
      expectation from mid-single digit growth to high-single digit growth for 
      the full year. 
   -- Operating income. As a result of the above factors, we expect high-single 
      digit underlying operating income growth for the full year. 
   -- Effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate outlook continues to be in the 
      range of approximately 22-23%. 

We continue to anticipate that our quarterly results will be volatile for the remainder of fiscal 2022, particularly underlying advertising expense and underlying operating income, as a result of the unusual comparisons to last year.

      policies and conditions; protectionist trade policies, or economic or 
      trade sanctions, including additional retaliatory tariffs on American 
      whiskeys and the effectiveness of our actions to mitigate the negative 
      impact on our margins, sales, and distributors; compliance with local 
      trade practices and other regulations; terrorism; and health pandemics 
   -- Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and

See ""Note 2 - Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for details on our use of Non-GAAP financial measures, how these measures are calculated and the reasons why we believe this information is useful to readers.

Note 1 - Percentage growth rates are compared to the same prior-year periods, unless otherwise noted.

Note 2 - Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information. We use certain financial measures in this press release that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures, defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under GAAP. Other companies may not define or calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same way. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures are presented on Schedules A, B, C, and D of this press release.

""Underlying change"" in measures of statements of operations. We present changes in certain measures, or line items, of the statements of operations that are adjusted to an ""underlying"" basis. We use ""underlying change"" for the following measures of the statements of operations: (a) underlying net sales; (b) underlying gross profit; (c) underlying advertising expenses; (d) underlying selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses; (e) underlying other expense (income) net; (f) underlying operating expenses*; and (g) underlying operating income. To calculate these measures, we adjust, as applicable, for (1) acquisitions and divestitures, (2) foreign exchange, (3) estimated net changes in distributor inventories, (4) impairment charges, and (5) Foundation. We explain these adjustments below. 


   -- ""Acquisitions and divestitures."" This adjustment removes (a) the gain or 
      loss recognized on sale of divested brands, (b) any non-recurring effects 
      related to our acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., transaction, 
      transition, and integration costs), and (c) the effects of operating 
      activity related to acquired and divested brands for periods not 
      comparable year over year (non-comparable periods). Excluding 
      non-comparable periods allows us to include the effects of acquired and 
      divested brands only to the extent that results are comparable year over 
      year. During fiscal 2021, we sold our Early Times, Canadian Mist, and 
      Collingwood brands and related assets, which resulted in a pre-tax gain 
      of $127 million, and entered into a related transition services agreement 
      (TSA) for these brands. Also, during fiscal 2021, we acquired Part Time 
      Rangers Limited, which owns Part Time Rangers RTDs. This adjustment 
      removes (a) transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions 
      and divestitures, (b) the gain on sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist, and 
      Collingwood and related assets, (c) operating activity for the 
      non-comparable period for Early Times, Canadian Mist, and Collingwood, 
      which is activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, (d) the net sales 
      and operating expenses recognized pursuant to the TSA related to (i) 
      contract bottling services and (ii) distribution services in certain 
      markets, and (e) operating activity for Part Time Rangers Holdings 
      Limited for the non-comparable period, which is activity in the first two 
      quarters of fiscal 2021. We believe that these adjustments allow for us 
      to better understand our underlying results on a comparable basis. 
   -- ""Foreign exchange."" We calculate the percentage change in certain line 
      items of the statements of operations in accordance with GAAP and adjust 
      to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. Adjusting for 
      foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a 
      constant-dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the 
      underlying trend both positively and negatively. (In this report, 
      ""dollar"" always means the U.S. dollar unless stated otherwise.) To 
      eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing 
      across periods, we translate current-year results at prior-year rates and 
      remove transactional and hedging foreign exchange gains and losses from 
      current- and prior-year periods. 
   -- ""Estimated net change in distributor inventories."" This adjustment refers 
      to the estimated net effect of changes in distributor inventories on 
      changes in certain line items of the statements of operations. For each 
      period compared, we use our volumetric shipment information and depletion 
      information from our distributors to estimate the effect of distributor 
      inventory changes in certain line items of the statements of operations. 
      We believe that this adjustment reduces the effect of fluctuating levels 
      of distributor inventories on changes in certain line items of the 
      statements of operations and allows us to understand better our 
      underlying results and trends. 
   -- ""Impairment charges."" This adjustment removes the impact of impairment 
      charges from our results of operations. During the first half of fiscal 
      2022, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $9 million for certain 
      fixed assets. We believe that this adjustment allows for us to better 
      understand our underlying results on a comparable basis. 
   -- ""Foundation."" In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we committed $20 
      million to the Brown-Forman Foundation (the Foundation) to support the 
      company's charitable giving program in the communities where our 
      employees live and work. This adjustment removes the $20 million 
      commitment to the Foundation from our underlying SG&A expenses and 
      underlying operating income to present our underlying results on a 
      comparable basis. 

We use the non-GAAP measures ""underlying change"" to: (a) understand our performance from period to period on a consistent basis; (b) compare our performance to that of our competitors; (c) calculate components of management incentive compensation; (d) plan and forecast; and (e) communicate our financial performance to the board of directors, stockholders, and investment community. We have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure.

When we provide guidance for underlying change for certain measures of the statements of operations, we do not provide guidance for the corresponding GAAP change because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including the estimated net change in distributor inventories and foreign exchange, each of which could have a significant impact to our GAAP income statement measures.

Free cash flow. This measure refers to the cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows above. In Schedule D, we provide this calculation for the relevant time periods. We use this non-GAAP measure in evaluating the Company's financial performance, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Note 3 - Definitions

From time to time, to explain our results of operations or to highlight trends and uncertainties affecting our business, we aggregate markets according to stage of economic development as defined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF ), and we aggregate brands by beverage alcohol category. Below, we define aggregations used in this press release.

Geographic Aggregations.

      whiskey and wine, and contract bottling regardless of customer location. 

Brand Aggregations.

In Schedule B, we provide supplemental information for our largest brands ranked by percentage of total fiscal 2021 net sales. In addition to brands that are listed by name, we include the following aggregations: 


   -- ""Whiskey"" includes all whiskey spirits and whiskey-based flavored 
      liqueurs, ready-to-drink (RTD), and ready-to-pour products (RTP). The 
      brands included in this category are the Jack Daniel's family of brands, 
      the Woodford Reserve family of brands (Woodford Reserve), the Old 
      Forester family of brands (Old Forester), GlenDronach, Benriach, 
      Glenglassaugh, Slane Irish Whiskey, and Coopers' Craft. 
   -- ""American whiskey"" includes the Jack Daniel's family of brands, premium 
      bourbons (defined below), and super-premium American whiskey (defined 
      below). 
   -- ""Jack Daniel's family of brands"" includes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey 
      (JDTW), Jack Daniel's RTD and RTP products (JD RTD/RTP), Jack Daniel's 
      Tennessee Honey (JDTH), Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire 
      (JDTF), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple (JDTA), Jack Daniel's Single Barrel 
      Collection (JDSB), Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye Whiskey (JDTR), Jack 
      Daniel's No. 27 Gold Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select, and

      Cocktails, Jack Daniel's & Diet Cola, Jack & Ginger, Jack Daniel's Double 
      Jack, Gentleman Jack & Cola, Jack Daniel's American Serve, Jack Daniel's

      Winter Jack RTP. 
 
   -- ""Premium bourbons"" includes Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, and Coopers' 
      Craft. 
 
   -- ""Super-premium American whiskey"" includes Woodford Reserve, Gentleman 
      Jack, JDSB, JDTR, Jack Daniel's No. 27 Gold Tennessee Whiskey, and Jack 
      Daniel's Sinatra Select. 
   -- ""Tequila"" includes the Herradura family of brands (Herradura), el Jimador, 
      New Mix, Pepe Lopez, and Antiguo. 
   -- ""Wine"" includes Korbel Champagnes and Sonoma-Cutrer  wines. 
   -- ""Vodka"" includes Finlandia. 
   -- ""Non-branded and bulk"" includes our net sales of used barrels, bulk 
      whiskey and wine, and contract bottling regardless of customer location. 

Other Metrics. 


   -- ""Depletions."" We generally record revenues when we ship our products to 
      our customers. ""Depletions"" is a term commonly used in the beverage 
      alcohol industry to describe volume. Depending on the context, 
      ""depletions"" usually means either (a) our shipments directly to retail or 
      wholesale customers for owned distribution markets or (b) shipments from 
      our distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers in other markets. 
      We believe that depletions measure volume in a way that more closely 
      reflects consumer demand than our shipments to distributor customers do. 
      In this document, unless otherwise specified, we refer to ""depletions"" 
      when discussing volume. 
   -- ""Drinks-equivalent."" Volume is discussed on a nine-liter equivalent unit 
      basis (nine-liter cases) unless otherwise specified. At times, we use a 
      ""drinks-equivalent"" measure for volume when comparing single-serve 
      ready-to-drink or ready-to-pour brands to a parent spirits brand. 
      ""Drinks-equivalent"" depletions are RTD and RTP nine-liter cases converted 
      to nine-liter cases of a parent brand on the basis of the number of 
      drinks in one nine-liter case of the parent brand. To convert RTD volumes 
      from a nine-liter case basis to a drinks-equivalent nine-liter case basis, 
      RTD nine-liter case volumes are divided by 10, while RTP nine-liter case 
      volumes are divided by 5. 

Note 4 - Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails 9L Depletions

Effective April 1, 2021, we entered into a partnership with Pabst Brewing Company for the supply, sales, and distribution of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails in the United States. Consequently, our fiscal 2022 results include net sales, but do not include 9L depletions for this brand. To share results on a comparable basis for fiscal 2022, we excluded fiscal 2021 9L depletions for Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails in the United States.

Transaction Summary

KKR CLO 37 Ltd. (the issuer) is an arbitrage cash flow collateralized loan obligation (CLO) that will be managed by KKR Financial Advisors II, LLC. Net proceeds from the issuance of the secured notes, subordinated notes and incurrence of class A-1L loans will provide financing on a portfolio of approximately $500 million of primarily first lien senior secured leveraged loans.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Asset Credit Quality (Negative): The average credit quality of the indicative portfolio is 'B'/'B-', which is in line with that of recent CLOs. Issuers rated in the 'B' rating category denote a highly speculative credit quality; however, the class A-2, B-1, B-2, C and D notes benefit from credit enhancement of 35.0%, 24.0%, 24.0%, 18.0% and 12.0%, respectively, and standard U.S. CLO structural features.

Asset Security (Positive): The indicative portfolio consists of 98.9% first-lien senior secured loans and has a weighted average recovery assumption of 74.0%. Fitch stressed the indicative portfolio by assuming a higher portfolio concentration of assets with lower recovery prospects and further reduced recovery assumptions for higher rating stresses.

Portfolio Composition (Positive): The largest three industries may comprise up to 40.0% of the portfolio balance in aggregate, while the top five obligors can represent up to 12.5% of the portfolio balance in aggregate. The level of diversity required by industry, obligor and geographic concentrations is in line with other recent U.S. CLOs.

Portfolio Management (Neutral): The transaction has a 5.1-year reinvestment period and reinvestment criteria similar to other U.S. CLOs. Fitch's analysis was based on a stressed portfolio created by adjusting the indicative portfolio to reflect permissible concentration limits and collateral quality test levels.

Cash Flow Analysis (Positive): Fitch used a customized proprietary cash flow model to replicate the principal and interest waterfalls and assess the effectiveness of various structural features of the transaction. In our stress scenarios, the class A-2, B-1, B-2, C and D notes can withstand default rates of up to 59.4%, 54.7%, 54.7%, 50.2% and 42.9%, respectively, assuming portfolio recovery rates of 37.5%, 46.4%, 46.4%, 55.9% and 65.6% in Fitch's 'AAAsf', 'AAsf', 'AAsf', 'A+sf', and 'BBBsf' scenarios, respectively.

RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:

Variability in key model assumptions, such as decreases in recovery rates and increases in default rates, could result in a downgrade. Fitch evaluated the notes' sensitivity to potential changes in such a metric. The results under these sensitivity scenarios are between 'A-sf' and 'AAAsf' for class A-2 notes, between 'BB+sf' and 'AA+sf' for class B-1 and B-2 notes, between 'B+sf' and 'AA-sf' for class C notes, and between less than 'B-sf' and 'BBB+sf' for class D notes.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:

Upgrade scenarios are not applicable to the class A-2 notes, as these notes are in the highest rating category of 'AAAsf'. Variability in key model assumptions, such as increases in recovery rates and decreases in default rates, could result in an upgrade on the class B-1, B-2, C and D notes. Fitch evaluated the notes' sensitivity to potential changes in such metrics; results under these sensitivity scenarios are 'AAAsf' for class B-1 and B-2 notes, between 'A+sf' and 'AA+sf' for class C notes, and 'A+sf' for class D notes.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Structured Finance transactions have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of seven notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of seven notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAAsf' to 'Dsf'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579 .

USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

The majority of the underlying assets or risk-presenting entities have ratings or credit opinions from Fitch and/or other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and/or European Securities and Markets Authority-registered rating agencies. Fitch has relied on the practices of the relevant groups within Fitch and/or other rating agencies to assess the asset portfolio information.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for its rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool was not prepared for this transaction. Offering Documents for this market sector typically do not include RW&Es that are available to investors and that relate to the asset pool underlying the trust. Therefore, Fitch credit reports for this market sector will not typically include descriptions of RW&Es.

Press Release: Fitch to Rate KKR CLO 37 Ltd.; -2-

Copyright © 2021 by Fitch Ratings, Inc ., Fitch Ratings Ltd . and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001

Fitch Ratings, Inc . is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the ""NRSRO""). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory  ), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the ""non-NRSROs"") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.

The best malls, especially those with luxury brands as tenants, are doing fine. Sales have recovered and they have been able to renew debts: The International Plaza in Florida, which is part-owned by Simon Property Group, refinanced a $477 million loan in October at a low 2% floating rate, based on data from Trepp. But poorer-quality malls are struggling to attract the tenants and capital they need.

Some owners are looking for the exit. Europe-based Unibail Rodamco Westfield in particular wants to get rid of certain U.S. assets to pay down debt it shouldered in 2018 to buy Westfield's portfolio, including the namesake malls in New York and San Francisco. Its borrowings are now equivalent to 16.6 times projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Reducing that to its target of nine times would allow the company to concentrate on its more attractive European business and might revive interest in its stock, which is down almost 60% since the start of 2020.

Major landlords have already started to cut losses on the weakest locations by handing them back to lenders, usually malls where the debt is worth more than the property itself. The Westfield Palm Desert mall, for example, was recently valued at $85 million and had $125 million of debt outstanding. Simon and Brookfield Property have also put what they consider no-hope malls into voluntary foreclosure.

In total, owners have handed over the keys to more than 20 U.S. malls since Covid-19 first spread, according to Green Street. But this is still only a fraction of America's so-called Grade B and C malls.

Some struggling properties could be converted to other uses. In April, landlord Macerich sold a stake in the Paradise Valley Mall in Phoenix for $100 million to a developer who plans to convert it into new homes and offices. Malls are usually built on large sites with decent access to infrastructure, so can be candidates for redevelopment. Westfield has approval to convert space in its New Jersey and Maryland malls into mixed-use properties, including homes. Another option is to turn them into e-commerce warehouses or distribution centers. Amazon has opened a new fulfillment facility in Ohio on an old mall site.

While these ideas look good on paper, only a trickle of sales and revamps have actually happened. Around 50 enclosed regional U.S. malls have been sold during the pandemic, according to a professional handling the auctions, most of them by lenders. The limited number of ""healthy"" malls sold may reflect unrealistic asking prices, the difficulty of getting finance for retail deals and the fact that converting them is capital intensive. Developers often prefer to buy land and avoid the expense and complexity of tearing down an old mall.

Landlords may be biding their time until footfall and occupancy rates recover from the pandemic in the hope of getting a better price. This makes sense considering Unibail said third-quarter sales in its U.S. malls were above 2019 levels. Shares in Simon Property, which mostly owns high-quality malls, are back above precrisis levels.

Some investors are making contrarian bets on the most tired malls. Real-estate specialists Namdar Realty Group and Kohan Retail Investment Group have been buying assets cheaply and continuing to run them as retail locations. Turnbridge Equities made a killing this year when it sold a North Carolina mall for $95 million to Fortnite's owner Epic Games for the company's new headquarters. It paid just $31.5 million for the property in 2019.

But landlords can't see such buyers as white knights. The opportunists prefer to snap up assets in distressed sales, paying a fraction of malls' old valuations. Until more buyers think there is money to be made in mall makeovers, the likes of Westfield have a tough sell on their hands.

The soup maker says it will institute a second round of price increases beginning in January as the company works to offset rising costs tied to ingredients, packaging costs, logistics and labor. Higher costs squeezed Campbell's margins in the latest quarter, the company said, though elevated demand for its products and higher prices helped offset this pressure. Campbell CEO Mark Clouse said he expects inflationary pressures to increase further in the company's new fiscal year, though higher prices combined with other mitigation tools should offset rising costs in 2H.

""We are investing today in tomorrow's growth, whether by adding to our best-in-class management team or by building out operations around the world, to advance our vision of being the global protein company of the future,"" says company CEO Ethan Brown .

0948 ET - Worries over the past two months among crude-oil investors that the US's biggest crude depot in Cushing, Okla. might run close to empty are diminishing as stockpiles once again start trending higher. Crude storage volumes in Cushing's giant steel tanks dropped to a three-year-low of just 26M barrels early last month versus 62M barrels in November 2020. But since then, Cushing has seen three consecutive weeks of small weekly increases in crude storage. And today's weekly EIA report at 10:30 am ET may show the biggest week-on-week increase of the year, as a parallel report late yesterday from trade group API showed Cushing's crude storage jumped by 2.4M barrels.

0946 ET - ConocoPhillips refines the Asia-Pacific segment of its portfolio with a pair of deals that lowers its aggregate decline rate and diversifies its product mix in the region. The Houston company says its selling its Indonesia assets, which produced about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the first nine months of 2021 and had end-2020 proved reserves of roughly 85M BOE, to Medco Energi for $1.355B. ConocoPhillips also says it will use cash on hand to exercise its right to buy an additional 10% of Australia Pacific LNG from Origin Energy for up to $1.645B, boosting its stake in the natural-gas venture to 47.5%.

0936 ET - Soup giant Campbell says labor remains a challenge, though conditions are improving. Ongoing labor shortages constrained Campbell's production in the latest quarter, particularly in the company's snacks business, though Campbell said it's taken steps in recent months that are resulting in increased hiring, lower absenteeism, and improved retention of employees. Campbell said on a conference call that it takes 4 to 6 weeks for a newly-hired employee to get up to speed, but that the company expects improving conditions to translate into a recovery in inventory levels and supplies in the current quarter. Campbell shares rise 3.6% after the company reported lower-than-expected 1Q sales. (jesse.newman@wsj.com)

0936 ET - Southwest says it expects to generate ""solid profits and margins,"" next year, even as it expects 2022 to be another transitional year in its recovery from the pandemic. In slides for an investor day Southwest plans later Wednesday, the airline says it will fly less in 1Q, with capacity off 6%, but will be nearly back to 2019 flying levels over the course of the year. The airline says it has a number of revenue generating initiatives in the works, including a new fare product. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

0929 ET - Southwest says travel demand is strong and fares have been climbing, prompting the airline to raise its 4Q revenue guidance despite the emergence of a new Covid variant that has raised questions about global travel. Southwest now expects operating revenue to be down 10% to 15% from 2019 levels, compared to its previous prediction that operating revenues would fall 15% to 25%. ""Based on current trends, leisure bookings continue to come in above expectations for December travel,"" the airline says in a presentation for its investor day later Wednesday. The airline also lowered its fuel cost estimate by about 10 cents a gallon. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

0919 ET - Brazilian retailers face headwinds in coming months from a series of factors that will reduce consumer appetite for spending, according to Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Brazil's statistics agency says retail sales fell 0.1% in October from September and declined 7.1% from a year earlier. The consensus was for an increase of 0.6% in the month, Ramos says. Rapidly rising prices, rising interest rates, greater uncertainty about the country's fiscal situation and higher family debt levels will undermine consumer confidence and weaken retail activity in coming months, Ramos says. Brazil's central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate, the Selic, by 1.5 percentage points at its policy meeting later today, leaving the key rate at 9.25%. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

0852 ET - The Omicron variant has impacted airlines because of confusion over testing and requirements and travel restrictions, says IATA chief Willie Walsh . ""Anecdotally, it's clearly having an impact on traffic,"" Walsh says at a media briefing. He didn't provide any data on dented forward bookings or rising cancellations, in contrast to that provided by IATA on the initial impact of the Delta variant. Airlines including Ryanair have warned restrictions could impact the upcoming holiday season and early summer 2022 booking levels. (doug.cameron@wsj.com)

0739 ET - Trading in Reata Pharmaceuticals is halted ahead of an FDA advisory committee meeting on bardoxolone to treat patients with chronic kidney disease caused by Alport syndrome.

According to the document, the agency's review team ""does not believe the submitted data demonstrate that bardoxolone is effective in slowing the loss of kidney function in patients with AS and reducing the risk of progression to kidney failure.""

The company announced it has entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary that indirectly owns the company's 54% interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a 35% shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company. The sale to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion is subject to customary adjustments and is expected to close in early 2022, subject to certain conditions precedent. The Indonesia assets being sold produced approximately 50 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021, and had year-end 2020 proved reserves of approximately 85 million barrels of oil equivalent. The effective date for the transaction will be Jan. 1, 2021.

In addition, through its Australian subsidiary, the company announced that it has notified Origin Energy that it is exercising its preemption right to purchase up to an additional 10% shareholding interest in Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) from Origin Energy for up to $1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, subject to customary adjustments. The ConocoPhillips subsidiary currently holds a 37.5% APLNG shareholding interest and would own 47.5% of APLNG upon closing if the other relevant APLNG shareholder does not exercise its preemption rights. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 and is subject to Australian government approval. ConocoPhillips ' full-year 2020 production from APLNG was approximately 115 MBOED, and full-year 2021 distributions are expected to be approximately $750 million, excluding distributions resulting from any additional shareholding interest arising from preemption. The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020.

""Today's announcement reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our company across every aspect of our global portfolio,"" said Ryan Lance , ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer. ""The Asia Pacific region plays an important role in our diversification advantage as an independent E&P and these two transactions enhance that advantage by lowering our aggregate decline rate and diversifying our product mix. We are proud of our nearly 50-year history in Indonesia and pleased that MedcoEnergi recognizes the value of this business. We are also pleased to have the opportunity to effectively deploy the proceeds from the sale of our Indonesia assets toward additional shareholding interest in APLNG, which supplies LNG to long-term buyers in both China and Japan and is currently the largest supplier of natural gas to Australia's East coast domestic market, meeting over 30% of its total demand. Through the achievements of APLNG and its other shareholders, Origin Energy and Sinopec, APLNG has become a world-class integrated LNG operation. It will continue supplying customers in the Asia Pacific region with reliable energy that is lower in GHG intensity than many of the alternatives, and thus help meet energy transition pathway demand for years to come.""

SECAUCUS, N.J., Dec. 8, 2021

SECAUCUS, N.J., Dec. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Vitamin Shoppe (R), an omni-channel specialty retailer of nutritional products, today announced that its CEO, Sharon Leite , will be featured in the new season of the Emmy-Award winning series UNDERCOVER BOSS. The Vitamin Shoppe episode is scheduled to air on Friday, January 21 (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network , and available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+, as part of the hit show's 11(th) season.

Sharon Leite , CEO of The Vitamin Shoppe, commented: ""The opportunity to become a part of this ground-breaking series was one of the most engaging, inspiring, and humbling experiences of my life. This was an unparalleled chance to get into the field and see up-close the incredible commitment and dedication of our Health Enthusiast team members -- all without the filter of being the CEO. It was an unvarnished way to see first-hand what The Vitamin Shoppe does exceptionally well as a company and also the things where we could be better.""

During filming of the episode, Leite took on the guise of a former gift shop manager from Cleveland, Ohio who is looking for a new start in life. With her wig, costumes, fake glasses, and new persona well-rehearsed, the unrecognizable Leite visited three retail locations of The Vitamin Shoppe , as well as a distribution center, to discover the ins-and-outs of store operations, customer service, inventory processes, and much more.

Despite a 30-year career at some of the best-known names in retail -- starting as a co-manager of an Express store in the late Eighties -- Leite learned plenty along the with way from the featured Health Enthusiast associates, dealing with everything from systems outages to run-ins with warehouse robots. She also connected with each of the participants on a personal level, gaining insight into the life challenges that each of them juggles.

""On a personal level, I'm deeply grateful that I got to know the multi-faceted achievements, challenges, and life stories of the team members featured on this show,"" said Leite. ""They are true inspirations and continue to motivate me to make The Vitamin Shoppe a better place to work for every Health Enthusiast. We took this opportunity not only to reward the show's featured associates for the incredible work they do while also balancing the many stresses that life can throw at any of us, but also to make real investments in our systems and processes across many aspects of our workplaces. And for that, I sincerely thank the UNDERCOVER BOSS team and especially the Health Enthusiasts who participated in this show.""

Leite joined The Vitamin Shoppe in August 2018 and since that time has introduced a broad range of expansion and innovation initiatives, including developing a new technology-driven retail format, increasing penetration of the company's proprietary brands, expanding the business into Asia, pioneering an expansive CBD hemp extract merchandising program, and launching the company's first-ever franchising model. Her previous experience includes senior leadership roles at Godiva Chocolatier , Sally Beauty , Pier 1, Bath & Body Works , Gap Inc . and The Walt Disney Company .

The Vitamin Shoppe is a global, omni-channel specialty retailer and wellness lifestyle Company with the mission of providing customers with the most trusted products, guidance, and services to support them on their journeys of lifelong wellness. In the U.S., the Company conducts business through over 700 company-operated retail stores under The Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements banners and online at www.vitaminshoppe.com. Globally, The Vitamin Shoppe serves customers in select Asia, South America, and Central America markets.

This episode of UNDERCOVER BOSS was filmed in 2021 with comprehensive pandemic protocols in place during all aspects of production, under the supervision of a dedicated Covid-19 safety officer.

UNDERCOVER BOSS is a two-time Emmy Award-winning reality series that follows high-level executives as they slip anonymously into the rank-and-file of their own organizations. Each week, a different leader will sacrifice the comfort of their corner office for an undercover mission to examine the inner workings of their operation. After the broadcast, the show can be viewed online at CBS.com, including bonus scenes of The Vitamin Shoppe episode, and streamed on Paramount+.

Ongoing labor shortages constrained Campbell's production in the latest quarter, particularly in the company's snacks business, though Campbell said it's taken steps in recent months that are resulting in increased hiring, lower absenteeism, and improved retention of employees. Campbell said on a conference call that it takes 4 to 6 weeks for a newly-hired employee to get up to speed, but that the company expects improving conditions to translate into a recovery in inventory levels and supplies in the current quarter. Campbell shares rise 3.6% after the company reported lower-than-expected 1Q sales. (jesse.newman@wsj.com)

0936 ET - Southwest says it expects to generate ""solid profits and margins,"" next year, even as it expects 2022 to be another transitional year in its recovery from the pandemic. In slides for an investor day Southwest plans later Wednesday, the airline says it will fly less in 1Q, with capacity off 6%, but will be nearly back to 2019 flying levels over the course of the year. The airline says it has a number of revenue generating initiatives in the works, including a new fare product. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

0929 ET - Southwest says travel demand is strong and fares have been climbing, prompting the airline to raise its 4Q revenue guidance despite the emergence of a new Covid variant that has raised questions about global travel. Southwest now expects operating revenue to be down 10% to 15% from 2019 levels, compared to its previous prediction that operating revenues would fall 15% to 25%. ""Based on current trends, leisure bookings continue to come in above expectations for December travel,"" the airline says in a presentation for its investor day later Wednesday. The airline also lowered its fuel cost estimate by about 10 cents a gallon. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose)

0919 ET - Brazilian retailers face headwinds in coming months from a series of factors that will reduce consumer appetite for spending, according to Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Brazil's statistics agency says retail sales fell 0.1% in October from September and declined 7.1% from a year earlier. The consensus was for an increase of 0.6% in the month, Ramos says. Rapidly rising prices, rising interest rates, greater uncertainty about the country's fiscal situation and higher family debt levels will undermine consumer confidence and weaken retail activity in coming months, Ramos says. Brazil's central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate, the Selic, by 1.5 percentage points at its policy meeting later today, leaving the key rate at 9.25%. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

0852 ET - The Omicron variant has impacted airlines because of confusion over testing and requirements and travel restrictions, says IATA chief Willie Walsh . ""Anecdotally, it's clearly having an impact on traffic,"" Walsh says at a media briefing. He didn't provide any data on dented forward bookings or rising cancellations, in contrast to that provided by IATA on the initial impact of the Delta variant. Airlines including Ryanair have warned restrictions could impact the upcoming holiday season and early summer 2022 booking levels. (doug.cameron@wsj.com)

0739 ET - Trading in Reata Pharmaceuticals is halted ahead of an FDA advisory committee meeting on bardoxolone to treat patients with chronic kidney disease caused by Alport syndrome. The shares plunged nearly 40% on Monday after an FDA briefing document suggested the panel might not recommend approval of the drug. According to the document, the agency's review team ""does not believe the submitted data demonstrate that bardoxolone is effective in slowing the loss of kidney function in patients with AS and reducing the risk of progression to kidney failure."" Reata shares, which tumbled 38% Monday, partly recovered Tuesday, rising 11% to close at $54.42. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

",",coccsh,gsars,gout,c42,ccat,neqac,gcat,gcold,ghea,gmed,gspox,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,",,1645529455000,"Amazon , the nation's second-largest private employer, behind Walmart Inc ., had previously only required warehouse staff to wear masks if they weren't vaccinated against Covid-19 or worked in jurisdictions where face coverings were required indoors.

The company employs about a million workers in the U.S. and has gone on several hiring sprees since the start of the pandemic, mostly adding hundreds of thousands of hourly employees to its warehousing operations.

The directive was announced through internal communications channels to Amazon warehouse workers.

""The health and safety of our employees is of the utmost importance to us,"" the notice says. ""We hope this will only be required for the winter months and that further into 2022 we can return to our previous face covering policy, where permitted.""

It isn't the first time that Amazon has altered its stance on masks this year. The company in August began requiring all warehouse workers to wear them, regardless of vaccination status, in response to the rise of the Delta variant, which was spreading rapidly at the time. Last month, after Covid-19 infections slowed, Amazon said workers who showed proof of their vaccination status wouldn't have to wear masks unless local directives said otherwise. Now, the company has returned to requiring all warehouse workers to mask up.

Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Omicron had overtaken the Delta variant in the U.S. and accounted for an estimated 73% of infections for the week ended Dec. 18. CDC officials have encouraged people to wear masks in public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status.

The new variant's spread has been hurting businesses in a range of industries and it has led companies to temporarily close their offices or postpone plans for at-home workers to come back. Countries including Israel, the Netherlands and Germany have imposed new travel restrictions, and many large-scale events such as concerts have been canceled or postponed. This week, the World Economic Forum said it would postpone next month's annual meeting in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos for the second successive year.

In recent months, some U.S. companies have moved to require all workers and guests at their facilities to get a Covid-19 vaccine, including tech giants such as Microsoft Corp . and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc .

Amazon hasn't mandated that its workers get vaccinated though it has offered incentives for them to do so, such as bonuses.

Early in the pandemic, lockdowns and work-from-home life caused a significant uptick in online shopping, prompting a surge in orders that was difficult for Amazon to keep up with as some warehouse workers stayed home. The tech giant offered unpaid leave and a boost in pay for a time to encourage employees to work, but some criticized the company for being slow to enact policies that would limit the spread of Covid-19.

Amazon has defended its response to the pandemic, and said it complies with all laws and provides breaks and safety measures that are necessary to keep its warehouses operational. This year, the company has raised wages throughout its facilities and introduced new safety programs aimed at educating workers about body mechanics.

Still, some employees have begun to ask for a return of pay increases such as a $2-an-hour bump that workers received for a time at the onset of the pandemic. The Amazon Labor Union, an independent group representing workers in the Staten Island borough of New York City, on Wednesday filed a second petition for a union election.

The group withdrew an earlier petition last month after it failed to prove there was adequate support for a vote. The union, which operates without the backing of a major national labor organization, has said it seeks to achieve higher wages, create safer working conditions and increase paid time off, breaks and medical-leave options.

A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company's focus remains on listening directly to its employees and continuously improving on their behalf. She also said Amazon is skeptical that a sufficient number of legitimate employee signatures has been secured to warrant an election.

The National Labor Relations Board will review the filing and then verify whether the group has sufficient support for a vote before setting an election date, a spokeswoman for the federal agency said.

",",coccsh,gsars,c24,gout,ccat,c42,neqac,gcat,gcold,ghea,gmed,gspox,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,",,1645529477000,"Amazon , the nation's second-largest private employer, behind Walmart Inc ., had previously only required warehouse staff to wear masks if they weren't vaccinated against Covid-19 or worked in jurisdictions where face coverings were required indoors.

The company employs about a million workers in the U.S. and has gone on several hiring sprees since the start of the pandemic, mostly adding hundreds of thousands of hourly employees to its warehousing operations.

The directive was announced through internal communications channels to Amazon warehouse workers.

""The health and safety of our employees is of the utmost importance to us,"" the notice says. ""We hope this will only be required for the winter months and that further into 2022 we can return to our previous face covering policy, where permitted.""

It isn't the first time that Amazon has altered its stance on masks this year. The company in August began requiring all warehouse workers to wear them, regardless of vaccination status, in response to the rise of the Delta variant, which was spreading rapidly at the time. Last month, after Covid-19 infections slowed, Amazon said workers who showed proof of their vaccination status wouldn't have to wear masks unless local directives said otherwise. Now, the company has returned to requiring all warehouse workers to mask up.

Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Omicron had overtaken the Delta variant in the U.S. and accounted for an estimated 73% of infections for the week ended Dec. 18. CDC officials have encouraged people to wear masks in public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status.

The new variant's spread has been hurting businesses in a range of industries and it has led companies to temporarily close their offices or postpone plans for at-home workers to come back. Countries including Israel, the Netherlands and Germany have imposed new travel restrictions, and many large-scale events such as concerts have been canceled or postponed. This week, the World Economic Forum said it would postpone next month's annual meeting in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos for the second successive year.

In recent months, some U.S. companies have moved to require all workers and guests at their facilities to get a Covid-19 vaccine, including tech giants such as Microsoft Corp . and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc .

Amazon hasn't mandated that its workers get vaccinated though it has offered incentives for them to do so, such as bonuses.

Early in the pandemic, lockdowns and work-from-home life caused a significant uptick in online shopping, prompting a surge in orders that was difficult for Amazon to keep up with as some warehouse workers stayed home. The tech giant offered unpaid leave and a boost in pay for a time to encourage employees to work, but some criticized the company for being slow to enact policies that would limit the spread of Covid-19.

Amazon has defended its response to the pandemic, and said it complies with all laws and provides breaks and safety measures that are necessary to keep its warehouses operational. This year, the company has raised wages throughout its facilities and introduced new safety programs aimed at educating workers about body mechanics.

While there is a digital component, the organization expects 50,000 to 75,000 attendees at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other venues.

In a normal year, the show gathered close to 200,000 attendees, though it went entirely online last January.

""Right now we have exhibitors building booths in Las Vegas,"" CTA Chief Executive Gary Shapiro said Friday, adding that the exhibitor count was rising, not dropping. He said the event will proceed unless a government mandate were to make it impossible to host.

The newer Covid variant is driving increased Covid-19 cases across the country. It is causing companies such as Apple Inc. to reconsider plans to open their offices. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s big San Francisco healthcare conference, scheduled for mid-January, will be taking place online. And next month's Davos Economic Forum has been postponed for the second straight year.

Throughout the pandemic, the tech industry has tended to lead other sectors in taking health precautions. For the not-for-profit CTA, which represents the $422 billion U.S. consumer tech industry, CES is the trademark event. The show gathers companies from around the world to show off innovations and make deals with retailers, wireless carriers and other partners.

CES 2020, which hosted over 170,000 attendees and more than 4,500 exhibitors, was one of the last major U.S. events before the coronavirus lockdowns. The 2021 conference took place fully virtually, with companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Corp. hosting press conferences online.

This year's CES kicks off Jan. 3 with in-person press events. As of Tuesday, over 2,100 companies had committed to exhibiting at the show, with keynotes from Abbott Laboratories, General Motors Co. and Samsung. Digital show participants could access more than 50 conference sessions and keynotes online.

T-Mobile late Tuesday said its CEO, Mike Sievert, wouldn't deliver a planned keynote address in Las Vegas. Nor would he give a presentation virtually. The company will ""significantly limit"" its in-person participation at CES, with the majority of its team staying away from the event, according to a news release.

Samsung said it is ""closely monitoring"" the health situation and is taking steps, such as having a smaller team on-site in Las Vegas.

Companies have adjusted to launching products online and participating with colleagues, partners and reporters over Zoom. However, the lack of an in-person component of CES has an impact on the tech industry's deal makers, who find the show convenient for face-to-face meetings and chance interactions. Travel restrictions and quarantine requirements had already reduced the scope of this year's show.

TCL Technology, the Chinese company that builds inexpensive TVs and smartphones, plans to attend the show in person, with most staff coming from its U.S. operations. Currently, China requires people to quarantine for 21 days upon returning to Hong Kong , which makes it difficult for TCL to send many people from its headquarters. Aaron Zhang, the Shenzhen-based CEO of TCL's mobile division, is already in the U.S. in advance of the show.

""CES, for TCL, is very, very important,"" said Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL's mobile business. ""[We] can, in one week, meet with everyone in the industry.""

On Tuesday, iHeartRadio canceled its CES concert party, which was to take place Jan. 6. In a press statement, Amazon said, ""Due to the quickly shifting situation and uncertainty around the Omicron variant, we will no longer have an on-site presence at CES.""

The strike among plant workers in Omaha, Neb., Battle Creek, Mich., Memphis, Tenn. and Lancaster, Pa. started Oct. 5. The workers this month rejected a tentative contract agreement. Employees at those four plants make the company's various ready-to-eat cereals.

""We are pleased that we have reached an agreement that brings our cereal employees back to work,"" Kellogg spokeswoman Kris Bahner said. The company said last week that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union on the contract.

Veteran Kellogg employees will receive wage increases of $1.10 an hour, with newer staff and new hires making $24.11 an hour. Those newer employees will also get a new dental benefit. All employees will get a new vision benefit offering.

The Kellogg workers are one of several groups of employees, including workers at Mondelez International Inc. and Deere & Co., who have gone on strike this year. In some ways, power has shifted to workers during a countrywide labor shortage that has left businesses scrambling to find employees.

Kellogg, which is based in Battle Creek, Mich., where some of the workers were on strike, makes snack products like Cheez-Its and Club crackers as well as cereals such as Frosted Flakes and Apple Jacks.

Kellogg workers were asking for better benefits and pay after working longer hours during the Covid-19 pandemic. They also took issue with a tiered pay system where veteran employees made more money than newer hires who also had to pay more for health insurance.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) recently rallied with the Kellogg workers. ""I think people all over America are looking at you and saying thank you for having the guts to stand up for working people,"" he said in a video posted on his YouTube page.

The agreement, Kellogg said, includes higher pay for its employees, including cost-of-living adjustments. The contract that Deere workers voted to ratify in November also included those adjustments. Some analysts say these types of provisions could spread in future negotiations among unions and employers. The idea behind these adjustments is to protect workers' pay while prices are increasing unpredictably and quickly.

The Kellogg workers' strike lasted longer than a recent action at Deere, where workers walked out for more than a month. The Deere employees in November voted to ratify a new six-year contract with the farm- and construction-machinery company that included higher base production pay, general raises, pension funding improvements and bonuses. Workers for Deere had rejected two previous offers.

""We are seeing acute shortages in labor across all spectrums of the economy,"" Kellogg Chairman and Chief Executive Steven Cahillane said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in early November. ""This is resulting in absenteeism, high turnover, difficulty obtaining temporary labor, and, for some of us, even labor strikes."" The strike at Kellogg boosted costs at the company.",",K:XNYS,KEL:XFRA,KELL:XWBO,K:XSWX,0R1R:XLON,K1EL34:BVMF,K:XMEX,",",yoinco,kgggb,dk,deere,",",kgggb,bctwgm,",,",K:XNYS,KEL:XFRA,KELL:XWBO,K:XSWX,0R1R:XLON,K1EL34:BVMF,K:XMEX,K:XNYS,KEL:XFRA,KELL:XWBO,K:XSWX,0R1R:XLON,K1EL34:BVMF,K:XMEX,K:XNYS,KEL:XFRA,KELL:XWBO,K:XSWX,0R1R:XLON,K1EL34:BVMF,K:XMEX,","About 1,400 Kellogg Co. unionized workers ratified a new five-year contract on Tuesday, concluding a 2 1/2-monthlong strike with a deal the union says maintains workers' cost-of-living raises and guarantees no plants will be closed for about five years.

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
     -- Sempra Energy  (Sempra ) announced it has entered into a definitive 
agreement to sell a noncontrolling 10% interest in Sempra Infrastructure 
Partners L.P. (SI) to a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority  
(ADIA ) for $1.785 billion, which we view as credit supportive. 
     -- In our view, if Sempra  pursued even some of its higher-risk potential 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, Sempra 's credit quality would weaken, 
more than offsetting the additional sell-down on SI. 
     -- We affirmed our ratings on Sempra , including its 'BBB+' issuer credit 
rating. We also affirmed the ratings on Sempra 's subsidiaries, including San 
Diego Gas & Electric Co . (SDG&E ), Southern California Gas Co . (SoCalGas), and 
SI. The outlooks on all entities remain negative, except for SDG&E  which is 
stable. 
     -- The negative outlook on Sempra  reflects the company's minimal 
financial cushion from our downgrade threshold and potential strategic 
initiatives regarding expansion of its LNG business, including for Cameron LNG 
Phase 2. This would likely increase business and financial risk during 
construction and weaken credit quality, absent sufficient countermeasures. 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 22, 2021-- S&P Global Ratings today took 
the rating actions listed above. 
 
We affirmed our ratings on Sempra , and the outlook remains negative. 
The additional sell-down of SI provides cash proceeds to Sempra  to support its 
consolidated balance sheet and utility capital spending, partially offset by 
about $500 million that will be used to fund its share repurchase program, of 
which $300 million was completed in the fourth quarter of this year. That 
said, the company remains opportunistic on its strategic LNG growth 
initiatives, including potential projects in the U.S. and Mexico. We expect 
that Sempra  will determine its final investment decision for Cameron LNG Phase 
2 by year-end 2022. We expect that a final decision to construct higher-risk 
LNG projects would likely raise construction risk and weaken Sempra 's 
financial measures during construction, which would likely weaken Sempra 's 
credit quality. 
 
We assess Sempra 's business risk profile as strong. 
This reflects the company's mostly lower-risk regulated utility operations in 
California and Texas, offset by higher-risk midstream activities. Sempra  now 
owns approximately 100% of Infraestructura Energetica Nova S. A. B. de C. V. 
(IEnova), in addition to 50% ownership interest in LNG project Cameron LNG LLC 
trains 1-3 and other midstream activities. We expect the midstream business 
mix to reflect about 25% of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, with regulated 
utility cash flows from subsidiaries, SDG&E , SoCalGas, and Oncor Electric 
Delivery Co. LLC  comprising about 75% of adjusted EBITDA. 
 
We assess Sempra 's financial measures to have minimal financial cushion from 
our downgrade threshold. 
We expect consolidated funds from operations (FFO) to debt to be below our 
downgrade threshold of 15% for 2021 and to average about 15.5% for 2022-2023, 
indicative of only minimal financial cushion. Our base case for Sempra  assumes 
proportional consolidation of Cameron's leverage profile and cash flow, 
average capital spending of about $5.2 billion through 2023, offset by 
proceeds from its minority interest sales in SI. However, additional advances 
toward its LNG expansion opportunities could materially weaken the company's 
financial measures beyond 2023, absent sufficient countermeasures. We assess 
Sempra 's financial measures using our medial volatility table, reflecting the 
company's mostly lower-risk regulated utility businesses and effective 
management of regulatory risk. 
 
We apply a positive comparative ratings analysis modifier in our assessment of 
Sempra . 
This largely reflects most of Sempra 's lower-risk utility businesses, our view 
of SDG&E 's strong operational performance, track record, and technological 
leadership given overarching wildfire risk exposure among California electric 
utilities. SDG&E  is a global leader in wildfire prevention, and over the next 
several years, we expect it will continue to invest in technology and system 
hardening, further reducing its risk of causing a catastrophic wildfire. Our 
use of this modifier also reflects the underlying strength of its lower-risk 
utility subsidiaries, including SoCal Gas and Oncor. 
 
The negative outlook on Sempra  reflects the company's minimal financial 
cushion from our downgrade threshold and potential strategic initiatives 
regarding expansion of its LNG business, including for Cameron LNG Phase 2. 
Such an expansion would likely increase business and financial risk during 
construction and weaken credit quality, absent sufficient countermeasures. 
 
We could lower our rating on Sempra  over the next 12 months if: 
     -- The company's consolidated financial measures did not improve as 
expected and FFO to debt remained consistently below 15%; or 
     -- SDG&E  caused a catastrophic wildfire or Sempra  expanded its LNG 
business activities in a manner inconsistent with its credit quality either 
because of increased business risk or weaker consolidated financial measures. 
 
We could revise our outlook on Sempra  to stable over the next 12 months if: 
     -- FFO to debt improved to consistently exceed 15%; and 
     -- The company's decision regarding the potential construction of new LNG 
projects do not increase business risk or weaken consolidated financial 
measures.

The launch follows the successful publication by IBA of GBP SONIA Spread-Adjusted settings on an indicative, 'Beta' basis since May 2021.

""GBP SONIA Spread-Adjusted ICE Swap Rates are an essential component for how the non-linear derivative market addresses legacy contracts referencing GBP LIBOR ICE Swap Rate,"" said Bob Goodfellow, Head of GBP Rates and Inflation Options at NatWest Markets .

""The spread-adjusted settings have been developed in response to demand from the market for rates which parties to agreements can use to help address legacy non-linear derivatives, structured products and cash market instruments referencing GBP LIBOR ICE Swap Rate,"" said Tim Bowler , President of ICE Benchmark Administration.

GBP SONIA Spread-Adjusted ICE Swap Rate settings are available here, alongside IBA's GBP SONIA ICE Swap Rate settings. The settings are published for tenors ranging from one to 30 years and are determined in line with the methodology proposed by the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates in its paper ""Transition in Sterling Non-Linear Derivatives referencing GBP LIBOR ICE Swap Rate (ISR)"".

From January 4, 2022, the settings will be provided for use as a benchmark by licensees on and subject to the terms of their current GBP ICE Swap Rate licensing agreements.

"Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ",",ccat,neqac,nfiac,ntop,nttwn,ncat,ndj,nfact,redit,",,1639959094000,"""I see an asset that possibly some time in the future could be worth a lot more than what I paid,"" said Mr. Arias, who is 37 years old and helps his father run a small import business in Miami.

Nike, which reports second-quarter earnings Monday, is banking that sneakerheads like Mr. Arias and others will want to invest in virtual kicks as it looks to further expand the digital side of its business by tapping into emerging technologies such as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The tokens are essentially digital deeds that verify the authenticity of the items they represent as unique.

Earlier this month, Nike acquired Rtfkt (pronounced artifact), a startup launched in 2020 that creates NFTs of sneakers and other collectibles, for an undisclosed sum. Nike also recently filed trademark applications indicating it wants to sell NFTs of its sneakers, clothing and other goods stamped with its swoosh logo. Shortly afterward, the company launched a virtual play place on Roblox Corp.'s free online game platform where users can dress their avatars in Nike gear.

The moves speak to Nike's ambitions at a time when a range of fashion and other consumer-goods companies are racing to claim footholds in virtual worlds where people are expected to learn, work, shop and be entertained. Dolce & Gabbana, Jimmy Choo and Adidas AG have launched NFTs. Balenciaga worked with ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc., and Gucci worked with Roblox to create immersive digital worlds.

Nike didn't respond to requests for comment about its plans for Rtfkt. The startup referred questions to Nike.

Nike has long dominated the scarcity model in the physical world by selling limited quantities of exclusive items and hyping their uniqueness, said Erinn Murphy, senior analyst at Piper Sandler & Co. ""There's so much white space for Nike to conquer in the digital realm as well,"" she said.

The apparel-and-sneaker seller has spent years beefing up its digital business by launching apps like SNKRS, which offers users access to exclusive items and events. Analysts say the digital investments have been a boon for sales. Overall, Nike's net sales through its online channels have outpaced sales through bricks-and-mortar stores for more than a year.

Rtfkt, which was valued at $33.3 million after a funding round in May, designs its own virtual sneakers and avatars, which have collectively sold for millions of dollars in just minutes. The company has manufactured physical products through so-called ""forging events,"" where owners of the studio's NFTs can request to have their virtual sneakers made into real ones.

Nike could also release real-world exclusives with NFTs, and the tokens could be traded via digital marketplaces such as OpenSea.

Tech analysts say NFTs could pose financial risks to buyers because their value is largely based on speculation and thus they tend to be volatile. While NFT creators may tout the unique nature of the tokens, they sometimes create thousands for the same item.

It could take years -- if ever -- for NFTs to become major drivers of Nike's sales. But the company's peers are finding some success in the space. Adidas launched its ""Into the Metaverse"" NFT collection on Friday and made around $23 million.

Analysts polled by FactSet project Nike to have generated $11.25 billion of revenue in the three months ended Nov. 30, which would be roughly flat from the comparable year-ago period. Nike's stock price is up 12% over the past year, compared with a 25% gain in the S&P 500.

Nike, like other retailers that rely on manufacturing plants in Asia, has been hit by supply-chain woes stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic. Second-quarter profit could fall roughly 20% from the year-ago period, based on analysts' projections.

The company said in September that shipments were taking twice as long to arrive in the U.S. but that it had enough inventory for the holidays.

Selling NFTs might be one way for Nike to quickly sidestep the supply crunch.

Justin Bazdarich, a restaurant owner and self-described sneakerhead, said he is excited about Nike's purchase of Rtfkt. Mr. Bazdarich, of Brooklyn, N.Y., owns several NFTs, one of which cost $2,000 and is associated with a rotating virtual shoe that Rtfkt created in partnership with streetwear designer Jeff Staple.

""If a big brand is coming into play like Nike, then they're going to help educate people out there that this is the way of the future and will allow other industries to partake,"" the 44-year-old said.

The Biden administration has accused the Chinese government of engaging in genocide against religious minorities in the region.

Last week, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, following its near-unanimous passage in Congress. The law bans all imports to the U.S. from the region unless companies can certify that such products are free from forced labor.

China has rejected allegations of genocide and forced labor, describing their policies in the region as aimed at preventing terrorism and protecting national security.

Last Thursday, U.S. semiconductor giant Intel Inc. issued an apology to Chinese consumers, partners and the public following an outcry on Chinese social media against the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, which had published on its website a letter to suppliers asking them to avoid sourcing from Xinjiang. The original letter said that the restrictions were required in response to U.S. law, though it didn’t specify which law.

Other Western businesses, including fast-fashion retailer H&M Hennes and Mauritz AB and sportswear maker Nike Inc., have also recently been targets of Chinese consumer fury. H&M’s online presence was erased from the Chinese internet this spring after the Swedish apparel firm said it would stop sourcing from Xinjiang.

Walmart, for its part, was dragged into the controversy on Friday after users wrote on domestic social-media platforms—including Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service, and Zhihu, a Quora-like question-and-answer forum—that they were unable to find products typically sourced from Xinjiang on online stores operated by Walmart and Sam’s Club China. Sam’s Club is Walmart’s members-only wholesale retail chain.

Some users posted that online customer service agents had told them such products, including red dates and apples, were out of stock. A U.S.-based Walmart spokesperson declined to comment.

A check by the Journal found no Xinjiang product listings on Walmart and Sam’s Club’s China e-commerce stores. However, a visit to a Walmart store in Beijing’s central business district on Saturday found red dates sourced from Xinjiang still stocked on its shelves.

One Weibo user accused Walmart of “eating China’s rice, yet slapping our face,” while others said they were canceling their Sam’s Club membership, sharing pictures of their dialogue with customer service agents showing them terminating their contracts. Others said they would boycott Walmart stores.

Chinese social media campaigns are often not as organic as their overseas peers, as authorities and technology firms curate and heavily censor domestic online content.

Walmart’s internet backlash followed a very similar playbook to past nationalistic boycott campaigns on Chinese social media. The Communist Youth League’s social media account urged consumers to boycott Sam’s Club stores, while the state-run Global Times newspaper reported that Sam’s Club had stopped sales of Xinjiang products, citing unnamed sources.

The Global Times reported that cantaloupes—commonly known in China as “Hami melons,” after a city in eastern Xinjiang famous for producing the fruit—were now being sourced from the southern Chinese island of Hainan. It quoted a salesperson in a Beijing store saying that Xinjiang raisins hadn’t been on store shelves since May, though the employee didn’t know the reason.

Melons, red dates and grapes were among the largest fruit crops in Xinjiang in 2019, according to the most recent figures on the website of the region’s statistics bureau. Xinjiang is also China’s largest cotton producing region, accounting for almost 90% of the country’s cotton production, according to figures from China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

China is a key pillar of Walmart’s international expansion strategy, as the American retailing giant seeks to streamline operations to focus on e-commerce and the fastest-growing global markets.

China is home to 434 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, covering more than 69,000 square feet, as of the end of January, making the country Walmart’s second-largest international market by retail square footage, according to the company’s most recent annual report—second only to Mexico, where the big box retailer runs almost more than 2,600 stores.

In the most recent quarter, China proved to be a bright spot for Walmart’s international sales, Walmart President Doug McMillon told investors in an earnings call last month.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said in September that 30% of retail and consumer companies polled in its most recent business survey cited public backlash and consumer boycotts as a top concern, the highest among the major industries covered by the business lobby. More than one-tenth of the companies said they had reduced planned investments in China because of concerns about consumer boycotts.

Since Walmart’s sourcing of Xinjiang products began attracting attention online, competitors including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Hema supermarket chain swooped in to take a swipe at the U.S. retailer. Most conspicuously, Carrefour SA, whose more than 200 stores in China are owned by Suning.com, a domestic online retailer, shared a post on Friday carrying the hashtag “Carrefour Xinjiang Fine Goods Festival,” with pictures of Xinjiang-sourced products on its store shelves.

The social-media post on Carrefour’s official Weibo account included nine photos of apples, walnuts and cotton socks and hand towels for sale on its store shelves, with bright yellow labels reading: “I come from Xinjiang.”

A spokesman for Carrefour in France didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Suning didn’t respond to an email sent to its board secretary after working hours.

About Sutro Biopharma

Sutro Biopharma, Inc ., located in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage drug discovery, development and manufacturing company. Using precise protein engineering and rational design, Sutro is advancing next-generation oncology therapeutics.

Sutro's proprietary and integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform XpressCF(R) and site-specific conjugation platform XpressCF+(TM) led to the discovery of STRO-001 and STRO-002, Sutro's first two internally-developed ADCs. STRO-001 is a CD74-targeting ADC currently under investigation in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced B-cell malignancies and was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for multiple myeloma. STRO-002, a folate receptor alpha (FolR<ALPHA>)-targeting ADC, is currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers and was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for ovarian cancer. A third product candidate, CC-99712, a BCMA-targeting ADC, which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb , formerly Celgene Corporation , is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma and has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA . A fourth product candidate, M1231, a MUC1-EGFR, first-in-class bispecific ADC, which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Merck KGaA , Darmstadt, Germany, known as EMD Serono in the U.S. and Canada (EMD Serono ), is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with metastatic solid tumors, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These four product candidates resulted from Sutro's XpressCF(R) and XpressCF+(TM) technology platforms. Bristol Myers Squibb and EMD Serono have worldwide development and commercialization rights for CC-99712 and M1231, respectively, for which Sutro is entitled to milestone or contingent payments and tiered royalties. Sutro recently announced a partnership with BioNova Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize STRO-001, a CD74-targeting Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC), for patients with hematologic cancers, in Greater China, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Sutro is dedicated to transforming the lives of cancer patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need. To date, Sutro's platform has led to ADCs, bispecific antibodies, cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapies, and vaccines directed at precedented targets in clinical indications where the current standard of care is suboptimal.

The platform allows it to accelerate discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules through rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. In addition to developing its own oncology pipeline, Sutro is collaborating with select pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to discover and develop novel, next-generation therapeutics.

About STRO-002-GM1 Phase 1 Clinical Trial

STRO-002-GM1 is a Phase 1 trial for STRO-002 for patients with advanced ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer that have progressed or relapsed after standard of care treatments, to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability. The dose-escalation cohort for ovarian cancer has completed enrollment. The dose-expansion cohort for ovarian cancer has completed enrollment and the study is ongoing, with participation from clinical sites in the U.S. and in Spain. The study is inclusive of all FolR<ALPHA>-expression levels and a tissue sample from each patient is required for biomarker analysis. Patients in the dose-expansion cohort are randomized 1:1 to either 4.3 or 5.2 mg/kg STRO-002 and treated every three weeks.

About Sutro Biopharma

Sutro Biopharma, Inc ., located in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage drug discovery, development and manufacturing company. Using precise protein engineering and rational design, Sutro is advancing next-generation oncology therapeutics.

Sutro's proprietary and integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform XpressCF(R) and site-specific conjugation platform XpressCF+(TM) led to the discovery of STRO-001 and STRO-002, Sutro's first two internally-developed ADCs. STRO-001 is a CD74-targeting ADC currently under investigation in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced B-cell malignancies and was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for multiple myeloma. STRO-002, a folate receptor alpha (FolR<ALPHA>)-targeting ADC, is currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers and was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for ovarian cancer. A third product candidate, CC-99712, a BCMA-targeting ADC, which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb , formerly Celgene Corporation , is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma and has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA . A fourth product candidate, M1231, a MUC1-EGFR, first-in-class bispecific ADC, which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Merck KGaA , Darmstadt, Germany, known as EMD Serono in the U.S. and Canada (EMD Serono ), is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with metastatic solid tumors, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These four product candidates resulted from Sutro's XpressCF(R) and XpressCF+(TM) technology platforms. Bristol Myers Squibb and EMD Serono have worldwide development and commercialization rights for CC-99712 and M1231, respectively, for which Sutro is entitled to milestone or contingent payments and tiered royalties.

Sutro is dedicated to transforming the lives of cancer patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need. To date, Sutro's platform has led to ADCs, bispecific antibodies, cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapies, and vaccines directed at precedented targets in clinical indications where the current standard of care is suboptimal.

The platform allows it to accelerate discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules through rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. In addition to developing its own oncology pipeline, Sutro is collaborating with select pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to discover and develop novel, next-generation therapeutics.

   KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab) Plus LENVIMA(R) (lenvatinib) Approved in 
Japan for Patients With Unresectable, Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial 
Carcinoma That Progressed After Cancer Chemotherapy 
 
 
KENILWORTH, N.J. & TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 27, 2021-- 
 
   Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, 
and Eisai today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour 
and Welfare  (MHLW) has approved the combination of KEYTRUDA, Merck's 
anti-PD-1 therapy, plus LENVIMA, the orally available multiple receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, for the treatment of 
patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma 
that progressed after cancer chemotherapy. This approval marks the first 
time the combination of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA has been approved in 
Japan. KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is now approved in Japan, the U.S. and 
Europe for certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. 
 
 
   This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: 
 https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211227005014/en/  
 
 
   ""Rates of endometrial carcinoma have been steadily increasing in Japan 
each year, and there are limited options for patients who are diagnosed 
at an advanced stage or find their disease has returned,"" said Dr. 
Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Clinical Research, Merck Research 
Laboratories . ""With today's approval, patients in Japan with 
unresectable, advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma now have the 
option of the first immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
combination that has significantly improved overall survival and 
progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy."" 
 
 
   ""This is the first approval of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination in 
Japan,"" said Terushige Iike, President, Eisai Japan at Eisai. ""We thank 
the patients, families and healthcare providers who made this approval 
possible. By delivering this combination therapy, we are proud to 
provide patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma an 
additional treatment option."" 
 
 

The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival (OS), reducing the risk of death by 38% (HR=0.62 [95% CI, 0.51-0.75]; p<0.0001), and progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 44% (HR=0.56 [95% CI, 0.47-0.66]; p<0.0001), versus chemotherapy (investigator's choice of doxorubicin or paclitaxel). The median OS was 18.3 months (95% CI, 15.2-20.5) for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 11.4 months (95% CI, 10.5-12.9) for chemotherapy. The median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.7-7.6) for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.6-4.2) for chemotherapy. 


 
 
   The Japanese package inserts for KEYTRUDA and LENVIMA note that in the 
KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 trial, adverse reactions were observed in 395 
patients (97.3%) out of the safety analysis set of 406 patients 
(including 51 out of 52 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA plus 
LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions were hypertension in 249 
patients (61.3%), hypothyroidism in 222 patients (54.7%), diarrhea in 
171 patients (42.1%), nausea in 158 patients (38.9%), decreased appetite 
in 151 patients (37.2%), fatigue in 113 patients (27.8%), proteinuria in 
105 patients (25.9%), vomiting in 98 patients (24.1%), weight decreased 
in 91 patients (22.4%), arthralgia in 87 patients (21.4%) and 
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome in 84 patients (20.7%). 
 
 
   Endometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus, which is 
known as the endometrium, and accounts for more than 90% of uterine 
cancers. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 17,000 new cases 
of uterine cancer and more than 3,000 deaths in 2020 alone. KEYTRUDA and 
LENVIMA have each received orphan drug designation in Japan for 
endometrial carcinoma. 
 
 
   In addition to advanced endometrial carcinoma, Merck and Eisai continue 
to study the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination across several types of

The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03517449), a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled study conducted in 827 patients (including 104 Japanese patients) with advanced endometrial carcinoma who had been previously treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in any setting, including in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS, and PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1. 


 
 
   Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously 
every three weeks) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily) or 
investigator's choice, consisting of either doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2) 
every three weeks) or paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) given weekly, three weeks 
on/one week off). Treatment with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA continued until 
RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as verified by BICR, 
unacceptable toxicity, or for KEYTRUDA, a maximum of 24 months. 
Administration of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was permitted beyond 
RECIST-defined disease progression if the treating investigator 
considered the patient to be deriving clinical benefit and the treatment 
was tolerated. 
 
 
   About KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that 
works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help 
detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal 
antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 
and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor 
cells and healthy cells. 
 
 
   Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research 
program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA 
across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA 
clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers 
and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting 
from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different 
biomarkers.

   Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA 
 
 
   Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that 
bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, 
thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking 
peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. 
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can 
occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body 
system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting 
treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important 
immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all 
possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. 
 
 
   Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical 
manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early 
identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of 
anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and 
thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For 
patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, 
monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically 
indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, 
initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including 
infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty 
consultation as appropriate. 
 
 
   Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of 
the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires 
interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid 
therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to 
Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate 
corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. 
Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients 
whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. 
 
 
   Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher 
in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated 
pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, 
including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 
(1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) 
of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 
1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who 
were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 
23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. 
 
 
   Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving 
KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. 
Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 
days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in 
patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to 
discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients 
who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued 
KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. 
 
 
   Immune-Mediated Colitis 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with 
diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in 
patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In 
cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating 
infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated

colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, 
including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. 
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional 
immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led 
to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 
0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated 
KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. 
Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. 
 
 
   Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis 
occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including 
Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic 
corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional 
immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led 
to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 
0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated 
KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. 
Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA With Axitinib 
 
 
   First-line treatment of advanced RCC in combination therapy with 
axitinib (KEYNOTE-426) 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. 
Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout 
treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the 
drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, 
interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering 
corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, 
Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (20%) and increased 
aspartate aminotransferase (13%) were seen at a higher frequency 
compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with 
increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT 
>=3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved 
to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with 
either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent 
or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT >=3 times ULN was observed in 1 
patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 
patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT >=3 ULN 
subsequently recovered from the event. 
 
 
   Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies 
 
 
   Adrenal Insufficiency 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 
2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone 
replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on 
severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients 
receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 
2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% 
(17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic 
corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation 
of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All 
patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom 
improvement. 
 
 
   Hypophysitis 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can 
present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, 
photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause 
hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or 
permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis 
occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including 
Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic 
corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the 
majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to 
permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 
0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated 
KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. 
 
 
   Thyroid Disorders 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can 
present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow 
hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or 
institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. 
Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. 
Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, 
including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld 
in <0.1% (1) of patients. 
 
 
   Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving 
KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to 
permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 
0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated 
KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% 
(237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and 
Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% 
(1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were 
withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of 
patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone 
replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher 
in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving 
KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, 
including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or 
worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) 
receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 
2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. 
 
 
   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic 
Ketoacidosis 
 
 
   Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of 
diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. 
Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% 
(6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent 
discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of 
patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after 
symptom improvement. 
 
 
   Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis 
occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including 
Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic 
corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to 
permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 
0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated 
KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. 
Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. 
 
 
   Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative 
dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has 
occurred with anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or 
topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate 
nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA 
depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions 
occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including 
Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were 
required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent 
discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of 
patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after 
symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved 
in 79% of the 38 patients. 
 
 
   Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions 
 
 
   The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions 
occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who 
received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other 
anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported 
for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, 
pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, 
myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis 
(including exacerbation), Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, nerve paresis, 
autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular 
inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with 
retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including 
blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other 
immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like 
syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce 
the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to 
include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, 
duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, 
rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), 
arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; 
Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 
histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), 
sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant 
rejection. 
 
 
   Infusion-Related Reactions 
 
 
   KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, 
including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 
0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms 
of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion 
for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop 
infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

   Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
(HSCT) 
 
 
   Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive 
allogeneic HSCT before or after anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. 
Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease 
after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile 
syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications 
may occur despite intervening therapy between anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatment 
and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these 
complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of 
using anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 
 
 
   Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma 
 
 
   In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to 
a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased 
mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti--PD-1/PD-L1 
treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled 
trials. 
 
 
   Embryofetal Toxicity 
 
 
   Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. 
In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to 
initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception 
during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose. 
 
 
   Adverse Reactions 
 
 
   In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% 
of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to 
permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), 
autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy 
(0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions 
(>=20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), 
and nausea (21%). 
 
 
   In KEYNOTE-054, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to 
patients with stage III melanoma, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued 
due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (>=1%) 
were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious 
adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The 
most common adverse reaction (>=20%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%). 
In KEYNOTE-716, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to

   About LENVIMA(R) (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules 
 
 
   LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is a multiple receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), 
VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that 
have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and 
cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, 
including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet 
derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR<ALPHA>), KIT, and RET. The 
combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased anti-angiogenic 
and anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial 
cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and 
tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer 
greater than each drug alone. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, the 
combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody 
decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T 
cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity compared to either 
treatment alone.

   Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA 
 
 
   Warnings and Precautions 
 
 
   Hypertension. In DTC (differentiated thyroid cancer), hypertension 
occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC (renal 
cell carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + 
everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure >=160 mmHg occurred in 
29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure >=100 mmHg. In HCC 
(hepatocellular carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 45% of 
LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not 
reported in HCC. 
 
 
   Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been 
reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood 
pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and 
then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume 
at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently 
discontinue based on severity. 
 
 
   Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur 
with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and 
HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of 
LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of 
cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery 
or permanently discontinue based on severity. 
 
 
   Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or 
LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity 
occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 
arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical 
trials. 
 
 
   Among patients receiving LENVIMA with pembrolizumab, arterial thrombotic 
events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including 
myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%). 
 
 
   Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The 
safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been 
established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had 
an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. 
 
 
   Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated 
patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse 
reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic 
failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of 
patients. In HCC, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of 
LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure 
occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients; 2% of patients discontinued 
LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy, and 1% discontinued due to 
hepatic failure. 
 
 
   Monitor liver function prior to initiation, then every 2 weeks for the 
first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. 
Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, 
including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at reduced dose 
upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. 
 
 
   Renal Failure or Impairment. Serious including fatal renal failure or 
impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment was reported in 14% 
and 7% of LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, respectively. Grade 
3-5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% of patients with DTC and 
2% of patients with HCC, including 1 fatal event in each study. In RCC, 
renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + 
everolimus--treated patients (10% grade 3). 
 
 
   Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. 
Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently 
discontinue for renal failure or impairment based on severity. 
 
 
   Proteinuria. In DTC and HCC, proteinuria was reported in 34% and 26% of 
LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 
11% and 6% in DTC and HCC, respectively. In RCC, proteinuria occurred in 
31% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus (8% grade 3). Monitor for 
proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If 
urine dipstick proteinuria >=2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine 
protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or 
permanently discontinue based on severity. 
 
 
   Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea 
occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of

diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or 
permanently discontinue based on severity. 
 
 
   Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients 
treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, 
fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently 
discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any 
severity or grade 3-4 fistula. 
 
 
   QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred 
in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 
ms occurred in 2%. In RCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 
11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms 
occurred in 6%. In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% 
of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. 
 
 
   Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and 
periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients 
with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, 
bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT 
interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and 
resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity. 
 
 
   Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of 
LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or 
resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose 
interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred 
in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus--treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 
hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood 
calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during 
treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or 
permanently discontinue depending on severity. 
 
 
   Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across 
clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, 
RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and 
resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue 
depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms. 
 
 
   Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur 
with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, 
of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA 
as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently 
reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of 
patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage 
occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal 
intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had 
CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% 
of LENVIMA + everolimus--treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral 
hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of 
LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious 
tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in 
LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing 
setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery 
hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of 
LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical 
trials. 
 
 
   Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor 
invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). 
Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently 
discontinue based on severity. 
 
 
   Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid 
Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% 
of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level <=0.5 
mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level 
>0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 
In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + 
everolimus--treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, 
respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation 
of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in 
HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus--treated patients in RCC. 
 
 
   Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during 
treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. 
 
 
   Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in 
patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week 
prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks 
following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of 
resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications 
has not been established. 
 
 
   Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients 
receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as 
bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental 
procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. 
 
 
   Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and 
periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good 
oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry 
performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with 
LENVIMA. 
 
 
   Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA 
treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for 
at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental 
procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental 
procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the 
risk of ONJ. 
 
 
   Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement 
of adequate resolution. 
 
 
   Embryo--Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from 
animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when 
administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral 
administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the 
recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and 
teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the 
potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential 
to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at 
least 30 days after the last dose.

CHARLOTTE, N.C., and REDMOND, Wash., Dec. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp . (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE: TFC), as anchor investors in the Mission-Driven Bank Fund, on Thursday announced the issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to identify qualified candidates to manage the fund on behalf of investors. The RFP submission period will be open Dec. 2, 2021 through Feb. 4, 2022.

The Mission-Driven Bank Fund is a capital investment vehicle designed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to channel private capital and other resources to FDIC-insured Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which collectively are mission-driven banks. These institutions play a crucial role in serving the needs of minority and rural neighborhoods through affordable financial products that support small-business development, community development, affordable housing, and other initiatives that foster growth and create opportunity and prosperity.

The fund will provide ""patient capital"" to mission-driven banks serving historically excluded communities across the country, prioritizing social impact objectives over the fund rate of return. In addition to investment capital, the fund will be focused on providing access to support resources such as technical training, assistance in developing lending and investment products, banking operations, and more.

As anchor investors, Microsoft and Truist are seeking fund manager candidates that represent a diverse and inclusive pool of investment management talent including minority- and women-owned fund management firms. The RFP period is intended to ensure that the selected fund manager is well suited to meet the diversity- and mission-driven intentions of the fund. To achieve this objective, a partnership of fund managers or more than one fund manager may be selected. Microsoft and Truist will not be involved in the investment decisions of the fund.

More information and a download of the RFP can be found at RFP website. Questions about the Mission-Driven Bank Fund or the RFP process can be directed to mdbf@sullcrom.com. Interested candidates are encouraged to send an email to be added to the distribution list for news and updates affecting RFP submissions.

About the Fund

The Mission-Driven Bank Fund is a collaborative investment framework to drive capital investment and other funding to FDIC-insured MDIs and CDFIs that support low- and moderate-income, minority, and rural communities, enabling them to build size, scale, and capacity to in turn allow them: 


   -- To provide affordable financial products and services to individuals and 
      businesses; 
 
   -- To stimulate economic and community development; and, 
 
   -- To build opportunity and prosperity. 

In designing the framework of the fund, the FDIC engaged approximately 70 Chief Executive Officers of MDIs and CDFIs and their trade groups as well as potential investors, investment consultants, and philanthropic organizations. The creation of the fund supports the FDIC 's commitment to preserving and promoting mission-driven banks. The FDIC will retain an advisory role to support the fund's mission focus, but will not contribute capital to, manage, or be involved in the fund manager selection process or investment decisions of the fund.

Kroger raised its adjusted earnings for the year to around $3.40 to $3.50 a share from $3.25 to $3.35 a share as it earlier projected.

Kroger’s shares rose 7% to $43.11 in morning trading Thursday.

Merchandise costs, which includes advertising, warehousing and transportation, rose 9% to $25 billion.

The company said it incurred a last in, first out charge—an accounting method that deducts the most recent cost of goods from sales—of $93 million during the quarter, an increase of more than 300% over last year due to inflationary pressures, including from grocery and meat.

In September, Kroger said it was partnering with Instacart Inc. to deliver food and household staples in as little as 30 minutes. Grocery delivery has become a competitive market as companies ranging from upstarts to giants such as Amazon.com Inc. try to grab a bigger slice of consumer spending. Achieving consistent profitability from delivery is a challenge due to the high labor and transportation costs.

Kroger in October said it will add new fulfillment centersfor online orders in California and Florida, as well as in the Northeast—marking its first entry into the region—as part of its plans to expand its same-day and next-day grocery delivery services.

The Cincinnati-based supermarket company said net profit attributable to the company was $483 million, down from $631 million in the comparable period a year earlier. Earnings were 64 cents on a per-share basis, compared with 80 cents in the prior year.

Excluding one-time items, earnings were 78 cents a share. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings of 67 cents a share.

SANTIAGO, Chile, Dec. 2, 2021

SANTIAGO, Chile, Dec. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Chubb, the world's largest publicly traded property and casualty insurer, announced its most recent digital alliance with Betterfly, a Latin America digital benefits platform used by companies to encourage employees' commitments to self-care. The platform rewards healthy habits with charitable donations and life insurance protection that grows at no cost based on lifestyle choices that foster physical, mental, and financial wellbeing.

Betterfly has developed a unique embedded insurance B2B2C model and has chosen Chubb as its preferred insurance provider for Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. Chubb will make Betterfly's membership and benefits platform available to its consumer line insureds in these countries through existing distribution channels. The integration of Chubb's digital insurance into the Betterfly ecosystem uses the capabilities of Chubb Studio, Chubb's global digital product distribution platform.

""We are thrilled to start working together with Chubb to bring our Betterfly Effect to every corner of Latin America. This alliance combines Chubb's global expertise in risk management, data analytics, and superior claims service with our AI-based customer behavioral science to complement our prevention, protection, and purpose solutions. This is a huge step towards scaling our platform throughout the region and to our vision of protecting the future of 100 million people by 2025,"" said Eduardo della Maggiora, Founder and CEO of Betterfly.

""We are excited by this new digital alliance. Betterfly's wellbeing platform will convert good habits into tangible benefits, combining social purpose with financial protection,"" said Marcos Gunn , Senior Vice President, Chubb Group and Regional President, Latin America. ""I am pleased to join efforts with Betterfly for a healthier Latin America and to provide greater access to insurance protection for people, families, and businesses.""

Most people in Latin America do not have life insurance coverage. According to a Swiss Re Institute's Report from October 2020, the region had an estimated total mortality protection gap of US$14 trillion. Betterfly is making it easier and more affordable for individuals and companies in Latin America to access financial, insurance, and lifestyle benefits. Integrated with apps like Google Fit, Apple Health, and Strava, the platform tracks members' activities and rewards healthy habits, such as walking, exercising, sleeping, and meditation, with ""Better Coins"" that can be exchanged for charitable donations, lifestyle rewards, and increased life insurance coverage.

""We are reimagining both product and distribution in the insurance market and, through game mechanics and behavioral science, we are pioneering a new way of bringing financial protection to all, by empowering people to help others and take care of their mental, physical and financial wellbeing,"" added Mr. della Maggiora.

Chubb's technology, analytics, and data capabilities provide its global partners and their customers with a seamless experience. These capabilities are being utilized in Latin America with partners like Betterfly and in other regions around the world, including Asia and Europe. Specifically, Chubb's global digital product distribution platform, Chubb Studio, allows business partners to quickly and easily add ""white label"" insurance offers to their existing digital platforms, with significant speed-to-market capabilities. Additionally, it provides a secure and scalable platform with multiple APIs to simplify the process. The platform enables Chubb's partners in retail, e-commerce, banking, fintech, airline, telecommunications, and other industries to add digital insurance options to their product and service offerings, as well as the ability for their customers to submit claims 100% digitally within their ecosystems and platforms.

CEO Chris Kempczinski says the company will add selective technologies to restaurants, like voice-recognition in drive-throughs and app ordering. Both can reduce labor needs, but workers will still be important to its business, Kempczinski says at a Morgan Stanley investor conference. ""There isn't going to be an 'aha' moment where we unveil a fully automated kitchen. We are still a people business,"" he says. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1637 ET - McDonald's pared down its menu during the pandemic to focus on core items, and the company has found its margins improved as a result, CEO Chris Kempczinski says at a Morgan Stanley investor conference. The company can do more to market core items in burger, chicken and coffee, which drive around 70% of the fast-food company's sales, he says. McDonald's is now introducing plant-based burger options in certain countries, but they remain optional for markets based on consumer interest, he says. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1623 ET - McDonald's wasn't early among restaurant chains implementing a loyalty program for customers, but it hopes to be one of the biggest ones now that it's moving in that direction. The burger chain is rolling out loyalty programs across the world to try and boost visits through marketing and promotions. ""Our aspiration is to be the biggest global loyalty program in the world, and we are on our way to do that,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski says at a Morgan Stanley investor conference.

1621 ET - NASA is doling out funds to help companies develop three new, privately run space stations as the deorbiting date for the International Space Station looms. Jeff Bezos ' Blue Origin, working with Sierra Space and others, wins $130M for its proposed facility, while NASA slates $160M for the floating lab envisioned by Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin . Northrop Grumman , working with a unit of Leidos, is in line for $125.6M. The ISS, which costs NASA up to $4B annually to run, may be able to continue operating until 2030, but the facility has dealt with cracks and leaks, according to a recent report from NASA's inspector general. If there is a gap between when the ISS is retired and the planned future facilities, ""the nascent low Earth orbit commercial space economy would likely collapse, with cascading impacts to commercial space transportation capabilities, in-space manufacturing, and microgravity research,"" the inspector general's report said.

The S&P's previous streak of 1% or bigger moves was six days in October 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Dow is also on a three-day streak of gains or losses of at least 1%, while the Nasdaq , up 0.8% today, breaks a four-day streak. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

Most of the rate hikes were implemented during May, some in June and ""were fully flowing through"" in the 4Q.

1542 ET - The FDA plans changes to a produce safety rule that would require farms to conduct yearly assessments of their water systems to minimize potential food safety risks. The proposed rule, which aims to revise sweeping US food-safety legislation enacted a decade ago, follows several foodborne illness outbreaks tied to pathogens in the water used to irrigate crops. ""If finalized, we're confident this proposal would result in fewer outbreaks in the U.S. related to produce,"" said FDA 's Frank Yiannas . Compliance with a previous water rule had been delayed for years and was set to begin in January. FDA says it will ""exercise enforcement discretion"" related to agricultural water as the new proposal is considered. (jesse.newman@wsj.com; @jessenewman13)

The family dining chain has pared back on its menu to help operations during the crisis, resulting in a reduction in discounts, executives say at an investor conference. Demand is strong and people are willing to pay more to sit down for a meal rather than go through a drive-through, CEO John Miller says. ""I want the $9 omelet. I want the gourmet pancakes. I want the second round of coffee. I'm not here for a deal,"" Miller said. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1219 ET - Investors have retreated from casual-dining restaurant stocks since news of the Omicron variant, and executives say they are watching what it will mean for operations. California-based BJ's Restaurants says it hasn't seen any immediate impact to demand, and that it intends to keep its staff in place as opposed to last year when the coronavirus first hit. ""I think most companies would handle it differently, including BJ's,"" the company says when asked about the variant in an investor presentation. BJ's and other sit-down chains are still struggling to fully staff locations, and don't want to lose employees again. Shares are up 10%. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1205 ET - European stocks close lower as concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant weigh on market sentiment. The Stoxx Europe 600 drops 1.2%, the FTSE 100 declines 0.6%, the DAX slips 1.4% and the CAC 40 sheds 1.3%. Noting that equities have swung between gains and losses this week, IG analyst Joshua Mahony says: ""The see-saw week is still with us; swings in risk appetite have been dramatic and rapid over the past few sessions, and with the Vix still at an elevated level, and rallying further today, it looks like the hard-fought battle between buyers and sellers still has a way to go.""

1151 ET - With its new CEO, Lundin Mining is expected to have a new sense of urgency and focus on improving operations across its portfolio, according to BMO . In September, the miner appointed Peter Rockandel as its new head, and the investment bank says the improvements under his leadership will likely include a strengthening of the technical depth of the senior operating team. ""We expect that Lundin Mining will continue its focus on delivering value to shareholders and will continue to pursue M&A growth through the lens of this fundamental principle,"" BMO also says. Shares are up 6.4% to C$10.55. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)

1145 ET - Kellogg and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union have reached a tentative agreement on a contract for more than 1,000 US cereal-plant workers currently on strike. Kellogg says the agreement on a five-year contract includes wage increases and enhanced benefits for all workers, as well as ""an accelerated, defined path to legacy wages and benefits for transitional employees."" Workers will vote on the agreement Sunday, the union says. The strike, which began nearly two months ago, has boosted costs for Kellogg, prompting it to import cereal from overseas plants and cut back on grocery promotions to temper demand for products it can't meet. Kellogg is up 1.6% to $62. (jesse.newman@wsj.com; @jessenewman13)

1142 ET - Lands' End is seeing high demand for items such as outerwear and boots, but supply-chain challenges have kept some of those items out of consumer's immediate reach. Due to the constrained inventory, winter items could sell closer to full price in January than they ever had previously, when those items would have otherwise been marked down after Christmas time, a CL King & Associates analyst says on an earnings call. CEO Jerome Griffith agrees, adding that the clothing retailer sells a very large percentage of basics or seasonal basics. ""Those are going to have a much longer lifetime this year,"" he says. (kimberly.chin@wsj.com; @mskimberlychin)

1126 ET - Lands' End expects to incur about $15M in supply chain-related expenses in 4Q due to higher airfreight and inbound shipping costs as well as higher seasonal wages, CFO Jim Gooch says on an earnings call. It projects 4Q revenue around $560M to $575M. The clothing retailer lowered its full-year revenue outlook to around $1.64B to $1.66B compared with its prior guidance of $1.67B to $1.71B. ""This revenue guidance represents softness early in the fourth quarter mainly as a result of the lower-end stocks more than offset by a strong holiday weekend as we improved our inventory position,"" Gooch says. (kimberly.chin@wsj.com; @mskimberlychin)

1115 ET - Lands' End says 3Q sales were weighed down by inventory delays associated with manufacturing disruptions, particularly in Vietnam, and supply-chain delays, particularly with shipping. This resulted in lost sales and back orders during the quarter, CFO Jim Gooch tells analysts on a call. ""While we saw the impact of out-of-stocks in the third quarter, the actions we've taken to expedite shipments enabled us to recover inventory levels consistent with prior years going into Cyber Week,"" Gooch says. Lands' End reported $375.8M in 3Q sales, a 4.4% rise from the prior year's period. World-wide e-commerce sales fell 6% over last year due to inventory constraints. Lands' End slides 10% to $19.67.

1035 ET - A number of polls this week show leftist presidential candidate Gabriel Boric leading his conservative opponent ahead of Chile's Dec. 19 election. On Thursday, pollster Criteria said Boric would get 54% of the valid votes versus 46% for Jose Antonio Kast. That follows a poll yesterday by Data Influye that shows Boric with 47% support versus 34% for Kast. A Cadem poll showed Boric ahead with 39% against Kast with 33%, while a Pulso Ciudadano poll also showed Boric in the lead. Kast won the first round of voting with 28% support versus 26% for Boric. Both candidates are trying to attract centrist voters ahead of the runoff vote. (ryan.dube@wsj.com; @duberyan)

""Testing is a critical component of keeping schools open, even as vaccines are approved for new age groups,"" said Manoj Gandhi, M.D., Ph.D., senior medical director at Thermo Fisher Scientific . ""Schools need to have options for fast, reliable testing to quickly identify and limit the spread of COVID-19, and we're looking forward to delivering this service for Texas students and teachers.""

1542 ET - The FDA plans changes to a produce safety rule that would require farms to conduct yearly assessments of their water systems to minimize potential food safety risks. The proposed rule, which aims to revise sweeping US food-safety legislation enacted a decade ago, follows several foodborne illness outbreaks tied to pathogens in the water used to irrigate crops. ""If finalized, we're confident this proposal would result in fewer outbreaks in the U.S. related to produce,"" said FDA 's Frank Yiannas . Compliance with a previous water rule had been delayed for years and was set to begin in January. FDA says it will ""exercise enforcement discretion"" related to agricultural water as the new proposal is considered. (jesse.newman@wsj.com; @jessenewman13)

1321 ET - The global banking industry's outlook for the next 12 to 18 months is stable, Moody's says, as ""solid reserves and healthy capital and liquidity give banks a strong base as they emerge from the pandemic.""

A global economic slowdown, high global debt levels and the effects of unwinding of government and monetary support measures are also seen as risks to the stable outlook, according to Moody's .

Jeff Bezos ' Blue Origin, working with Sierra Space and others, wins $130M for its proposed facility, while NASA slates $160M for the floating lab envisioned by Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin . Northrop Grumman , working with a unit of Leidos, is in line for $125.6M. The ISS, which costs NASA up to $4B annually to run, may be able to continue operating until 2030, but the facility has dealt with cracks and leaks, according to a recent report from NASA's inspector general.

The NFIB's November jobs report shows 29% of owners report labor quality as their top business problem, a 48-year record high. According to the report, 93% of owners hiring or trying to hire reported few or no qualified applicants, with 26% saying they found no qualified applicants.

1336 ET - Companies in Brazil face reputational risk given that scrutiny over man-made environmental damage will likely increase, Moody's Investors Service says. ""Deforestation and other climate-related risks can quickly become material to credit quality if societal and regulatory scrutiny intensify,"" Moody's says, adding such hazards include reduced revenue from boycotts and bans. Brazil's protein producers ""face increasing stakeholder scrutiny over cattle-raising's links to Amazon and Cerrado deforestation,"" according to Moody's . Companies have been adopting measures, including monitoring cattle supply chains, to deal with the issue, Moody's adds. Last year, agriculture and protein represented 26.6% of Brazil's GDP and half of its exports, according to Moody's . (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)

1321 ET - The global banking industry's outlook for the next 12 to 18 months is stable, Moody's says, as ""solid reserves and healthy capital and liquidity give banks a strong base as they emerge from the pandemic."" While higher inflation won't immediately undermine banks' profitability, and may even benefit asset quality in the short run, ""persistently higher inflation accompanied by a sudden rise in interest rates would weigh on asset valuations and push up customer borrowing costs, raising the likelihood of loan delinquencies and elevated provisions,"" Moody's says. A global economic slowdown, high global debt levels and the effects of unwinding of government and monetary support measures are also seen as risks to the stable outlook, according to Moody's .

1248 ET - As cars become more digital even in the face of a global semiconductor shortage that has weighed on vehicle output, they will become a bigger user of memory chips, Micron Technology head of global operations Manish Bhatia says in a congressional hearing. ""Today the automotive sector is not a huge consumer of memory or storage, however it is, for Micron, the fastest growing market for us as we look forward into the next decade,"" he says, adding that the ""autonomous vehicles of the future are really going to have as much content as a datacenter does today.""

1234 ET - Crude oil futures are up 1.5% midday Thursday--with OPEC and its allies opting to raise production by 400,000 barrels per day in January. The decision appears to bet that the omicron variant of Covid-19 isn't going to derail a demand recovery extending into next year. ""While pandemic-related newsflow is likely to remain in flux, we expect the omicron variant to have a similar impact as the delta variant in our base case,"" says UBS . ""Hence, we look for higher oil demand and prices in 2022."" (kirk.maltais@wsj.com, @kirkmaltais)

1229 ET - Snowflake delivered a comfortable 3Q revenue beat, driven by higher-than-expected business from some of its large, established customers. Company officials don't expect a similar beat going forward but point to strong demand across the board. Asked for verticals they expect to take off, officials point to healthcare, the public sector and retail. ""Data is becoming the beating heart of the modern enterprise. So the race is on to lay the foundation for a digital, data-driven infrastructure,"" Chief Executive Frank Slootman says. Snowflake also reported its first operating profit on an adjusted basis. Asked about a possible update to long-term financial targets, CFO Mike Scarpelli says: ""I clearly do think there is upside to both of our operating margin and free cash flow margin."" He says the company intends to update long-term guidance at the investor day. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)

1219 ET - Investors have retreated from casual-dining restaurant stocks since news of the Omicron variant, and executives say they are watching what it will mean for operations. California-based BJ's Restaurants says it hasn't seen any immediate impact to demand, and that it intends to keep its staff in place as opposed to last year when the coronavirus first hit. ""I think most companies would handle it differently, including BJ's,"" the company says when asked about the variant in an investor presentation. BJ's and other sit-down chains are still struggling to fully staff locations, and don't want to lose employees again. Shares are up 10%. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

1205 ET - European stocks close lower as concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant weigh on market sentiment. The Stoxx Europe 600 drops 1.2%, the FTSE 100 declines 0.6%, the DAX slips 1.4% and the CAC 40 sheds 1.3%. Noting that equities have swung between gains and losses this week, IG analyst Joshua Mahony says: ""The see-saw week is still with us; swings in risk appetite have been dramatic and rapid over the past few sessions, and with the Vix still at an elevated level, and rallying further today, it looks like the hard-fought battle between buyers and sellers still has a way to go.""

1151 ET - With its new CEO, Lundin Mining is expected to have a new sense of urgency and focus on improving operations across its portfolio, according to BMO . In September, the miner appointed Peter Rockandel as its new head, and the investment bank says the improvements under his leadership will likely include a strengthening of the technical depth of the senior operating team. ""We expect that Lundin Mining will continue its focus on delivering value to shareholders and will continue to pursue M&A growth through the lens of this fundamental principle,"" BMO also says. Shares are up 6.4% to C$10.55. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)

1145 ET - Kellogg and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union have reached a tentative agreement on a contract for more than 1,000 US cereal-plant workers currently on strike. Kellogg says the agreement on a five-year contract includes wage increases and enhanced benefits for all workers, as well as ""an accelerated, defined path to legacy wages and benefits for transitional employees."" Workers will vote on the agreement Sunday, the union says. The strike, which began nearly two months ago, has boosted costs for Kellogg, prompting it to import cereal from overseas plants and cut back on grocery promotions to temper demand for products it can't meet. Kellogg is up 1.6% to $62. (jesse.newman@wsj.com; @jessenewman13)

1142 ET - Lands' End is seeing high demand for items such as outerwear and boots, but supply-chain challenges have kept some of those items out of consumer's immediate reach. Due to the constrained inventory, winter items could sell closer to full price in January than they ever had previously, when those items would have otherwise been marked down after Christmas time, a CL King & Associates analyst says on an earnings call. CEO Jerome Griffith agrees, adding that the clothing retailer sells a very large percentage of basics or seasonal basics. ""Those are going to have a much longer lifetime this year,"" he says.

About Yext

Yext (NYSE: YEXT) is the AI Search Company and is on a mission to transform the enterprise with AI search.

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword search technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions.

Yext , the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers -- not links.

Brands like Verizon , Vanguard , Subway and Marriott -- as well as organizations like the U.S. State Department and World Health Organization -- trust Yext to radically improve their business with answers-led AI search.

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants on U.S. and global markets, our business, operations, financial results, cash flow, demand for our products, sales cycles, and customer acquisition and retention; our ability to renew and expand subscriptions with existing customers especially enterprise customers and attract new customers generally; our ability to successfully expand and compete in new geographies and industry verticals; our ability to expand and scale our sales force; our ability to expand our service and application provider network; our ability to develop new product and platform offerings to expand our market opportunity, including with Yext Answers; our ability to release new products and updates that are adopted by our customers; our ability to manage our growth effectively; weakened or changing global economic conditions; the number of options exercised by our employees and former employees; and the accuracy of the assumptions and estimates underlying our financial projections.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof or to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.

Non-GAAP Measurements

In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating expenses (sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative) as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of revenue, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP as they have been adjusted to exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative) as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of revenue are calculated by dividing the applicable non-GAAP financial measure by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is defined as non-GAAP net income (loss) on a per share basis. See ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for a discussion of the applicable weighted-average shares outstanding.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. With respect to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative) as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net loss as a percentage of revenue, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our profitability relative to the amount of revenue generated, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. We also believe non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as these metrics eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation, which may vary for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. Our definition may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

These non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in their usefulness because they do not present the full economic effect of our use of stock-based compensation. We compensate for these limitations by providing investors and other users of our financial information a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely related GAAP financial measures. However, we have not reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under ""Financial Outlook"" to their corresponding GAAP measures because certain reconciling items such as stock-based compensation and the corresponding provision for income taxes depend on factors such as the stock price at the time of award of future grants and thus cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures is not available without unreasonable effort. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share in conjunction with net loss and net loss per share.

Operating Metrics

This press release also includes certain operating metrics that we believe are useful in providing additional information in assessing the overall performance of our business.

Customer count is defined as the total number of customers with contracts executed as of the last day of the reporting period and a unique administrative account identifier on the Yext platform. We believe that customer count provides insight into our ability to grow our enterprise and mid-market customer base. As such, customer count excludes third-party reseller customers and small businesses customers as well as customers only receiving free trials.

Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is defined as the annualized recurring amount of all contracts executed as of the last day of the reporting period. The recurring amount of a contract is determined based upon the terms of a contract and is calculated by dividing the amount of a contract by the term of the contract and then annualizing such amount. The calculation assumes no subsequent changes to the existing subscription and excludes amounts related to overages above the contractual minimum commitment. Contracts include portions of professional services contracts that are recurring in nature. ARR is independent of historical revenue, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligations or any other GAAP financial measure over any period. It should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to or in isolation from, these measures and other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe ARR provides insight into the performance of our recurring revenue business model while mitigating for fluctuations in billing and contract terms.

NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- ClaimsFiler, a FREE shareholder information service, reminds investors with losses in excess of $100,000 that they have until December 6, 2021 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (""BMS"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: BMY), if they received Contingent Value Rights (""CVRs"") (NYSE: BMY.RT) in exchange for their shares of Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) pursuant to BMS' acquisition of Celgene on November 20, 2019. This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Get Help

BMS investors should visit us at https://claimsfiler.com/cases/nyse-bmy-3/  or call toll-free (844) 367-9658. Lawyers at Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC are available to discuss your legal options.

About the Lawsuit

On January 3, 2019, BMS and Celgene agreed to a merger under which Celgene shareholders would receive $50 in cash, one share of BMS common stock, and one CVR for each share of Celgene common stock. Each CVR would provide holders a contingent right to receive $9 in cash if certain milestones were reached, which consisted of FDA approval of three applications by certain deadline dates. On January 1, 2021, BMS announced that one of the deadlines had not been met and terminated the CVRs.

The lawsuit charges BMS with failing to take diligent efforts to meet the milestones, as required by the CVR agreement, in order to avoid paying the CVR buyout. As a result, the statements in the Joint Proxy concerning the efforts BMS would make to meet the milestones, the likelihood that the milestones would be met and the purported value of the CVRs were materially false and misleading when made.

The case is SM Merger/Arbitrage, L.P., et al., v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company , et al., 21-cv-8255.

Air traffic showed signs of a further pickup in October, with world-wide air travel demand down roughly 49% from the same month of 2019, compared with a 53% equivalent decline in September. ""October's traffic performance reinforces that people will travel when they are permitted to,"" says Willie Walsh , director general of the trade body. ""Unfortunately, government responses to the emergence of the Omicron variant are putting at risk the global connectivity it has taken so long to rebuild."" (olivia.bugault@wsj.com)

1208 GMT - China's move toward recertifying the 737 MAX is key for Boeing 's production plan, but it still needs the rest of the Asian market to recover in terms of passenger traffic. Boeing 's delivered 185 of the jets this year, none of them to the region beyond three that went to Fiji Airways and a handful to lessors including China's ICBC and CDB. Boeing is on track to deliver around 230 of the jets worldwide this year. That's a fraction of the roughly 2,000 analysts had expected to be delivered from 2019 to 2021, before the March 2019 grounding. Boeing shares recently up 5% in pre open trade.

1224 GMT - Trainline's medium-term prospects are bright despite a fall in its shares, says Peel Hunt , increasing its recommendation on the U.K. rail-ticket retailer's stock to buy from hold. Peel Hunt points to positives such as the company attracting new customers at its highest rate ever, increasing the number of customers that make purchases twice a month or more by 29% and boosting technology investment. ""We upgrade to buy on recent weakness and medium-term catalysts, but trim our target price from 461 pence to 440p,"" Peel analysts say. Shares, which hit a year-to-date peak of 527p in March, fall 1.5% to 281p. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0517 GMT - Samsung Heavy Industries ' resale of one of its five undelivered drill ships will likely help improve its financial health, says Daishin Securities . The Korean firm's $245 million ship resale, following its rights issue worth more than $1 billion recently, should increase its cash flows, the brokerage says. Daishin expects the company's debt ratio tolower to 198% from 322% previously as it is bullish on a rising backlog of orders. Daishin keeps its marketperform rating on the stock, but cuts the target price by 14% to KRW5,600 to reflect the diluted stock price following the rights issue. Shares are 0.8% higher at KRW5,300.

0435 GMT - GUD Holdings ' acquisition of Autopacific Group provides the Australian auto-parts maker with greater exposure to the fast-growing 4x4 sector while increasing its manufacturing and customer diversification, Citi says. The bank also sees synergies and margin accretion from a combination that it says makes strategic sense. Citi warns that the move isn't without risk, with GUD paying twice Autopacific's 2019 price tag for a business that potentially is benefiting from border closures. Nonetheless, the bank maintains a buy rating on GUD shares and raises its target price by 19% to A$15.70. The stock is up 3.1% at A$11.11. (stuart.condie@wsj.com; @StuartLCondie)

0312 GMT - Ningbo Tuopu's first air-suspension-product factory could significantly expand its product portfolio over the longer term, Citi Research says. The recently completed factory would allow the automotive-parts maker to cover the whole manufacturing process for air-suspension system products, and Citi notes that growing demand for such products in the auto sector could become its next growth driver. Ningbo Tuopu may also ride on the strong business growth of key new-energy-vehicle players, including Tesla. ""We believe Tuopu would continue to secure high-quality orders from Tesla going forward,"" it adds. Citi raises its target price to CNY76.30 from CNY50.80 and maintains its buy call. Shares are 3.9% lower at CNY63.69. (justina.lee@wsj.com)

0248 GMT - Recovery of Cathay Pacific 's passenger flights will likely hinge on the border reopenings of China and Hong Kong, Daiwa Capital says. Airlines remain optimistic that governments will open international borders next year, on rising travel demand and higher vaccination rates, Daiwa says. While fewer passenger flights may be a concern amid uncertainties due to the Omicron variant, Cathay could benefit from higher contribution from its cargo business, as current supply chain constraints could boost demand, Daiwa notes. The Japanese bank cuts the stock's target price to HK$6.70 from HK$7.00 after lowering its forecasts for Cathay 's 2022-2023 EPS and maintains an outperform rating. Shares are 2.5% lower at HK$6.14. (justina.lee@wsj.com)

0229 GMT - Pacific Basin Shipping 's earnings may be supported by high freight rates, which are likely to continue on the back of recovering global economic growth in 2022, Daiwa Capital says. The company has received an increasing number of inquiries from clients recently, Daiwa notes, adding that Pacific Basin's current contracts cover around 20%-25% of vessel days next year. ""We are positive on the sustainability of high freight rates amid continued tight supply,"" Daiwa adds. The Japanese bank's forecasts for Pacific Basin's 2021-23 EPS are also 2%-22% above market consensus, citing its optimism on the shipping sector. Daiwa maintains its buy rating and target price of HK$4.50. Shares are 0.4% higher at HK$2.90.(justina.lee@wsj.com)

2053 GMT - The former finance chief of a suburban Chicago-based logistics company was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison for his role in an accounting and securities fraud scheme. A federal jury in July convicted Peter Armbruster, the former CFO of Downers Grove, Ill.-based Roadrunner Transportation Systems, with four counts of violating securities laws. Armbruster, who left Roadrunner in April 2017, inflated the company's income during 3Q 2016 by misrepresenting expenses, according to federal prosecutors. Andy DeVooght, a lawyer representing Mr. Armbruster, said in a statement that jurors in the case rejected several of the government's initial allegations. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. (kristin.broughton@wsj.com; @kcbroughton)

2024 GMT - Over two years after launching a procurement process, Canada said it has whittled down the list of bidders eligible to supply the country's air force with 88 new fighter jets. Canada said Lockheed Martin , with its F-35, and SAAB AB , with its Gripen aircraft, are the finalists. Canada's public-services department, which is in charge of the procurement process, said the finalists were chosen after a thorough assessment, including a focus on potential economic benefits across the country. Canada intends to award a contract next year, with anticipated delivery of fighter jets in 2025. A decision by Canada to purchase new fighter jets has dragged on for over a decade, after plans unveiled in 2010 to buy 65 F-35s were mired in political controversy.

1839 GMT - GM's CFO expects the auto maker to return to normal production levels by the end of 2022 as the computer-chip shortage eases. Paul Jacobson said the chip crisis has been less severe in 4Q. He expects 1Q next year to be similar, and then foresees gradual improvement in chip availability through the year. (mike.colias@wsj.com; @MikeColias)

1304 GMT - Norfolk Southern has tapped Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw as its next CEO, who will assume the role from Jim Squires in May. Shaw, who will be taking on the role of president immediately, is well-known to Wall Street, appearing on earnings calls to discuss market conditions in the railroad industry. As freight railroads continue to push forward efficiency and cost-cutting plans, the appointment of a sales-minded CEO appears as a logical step, as the railroads try to convince shippers to put more of their product on the rails. Norfolk Southern also elevated an internal executive, Ed Elkins, to fill Shaw's role as CMO. Elkins has been vice president of industrial products.

That follows a poll yesterday by Data Influye that shows Boric with 47% support versus 34% for Kast. A Cadem poll showed Boric ahead with 39% against Kast with 33%, while a Pulso Ciudadano poll also showed Boric in the lead. Kast won the first round of voting with 28% support versus 26% for Boric.

1000 ET - Novavax says it has started to develop a modified vaccine to specifically target the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, in case its original vaccine doesn't provide sufficient protection against the new strain. Novavax is running lab tests of blood samples from people who previously received its vaccine, to see if antibodies in their blood can neutralize Omicron. The company expects results in the coming weeks. Also, it plans in January to take initial steps to manufacture a vaccine ingredient that would target Omicron, for a potential booster shot. Novavax plans by the end of this month to submit a complete regulatory package to US health regulators seeking authorization of use of its original two-dose vaccine, while the shot has been cleared for use in Indonesia and the Philippines.

0941 ET - Crude oil futures are down this morning, with traders seeing the market as bifurcated. ""While there is a clear bearish monster at the gates, the Omicron variant, bullish traders are placing bets that OPEC+ changes course and lowers crude output, which if realized will add to the support coming from Pfizer 's efficacy confidence in its antiviral pill against the pandemic's latest strain,"" says Louise Dickson of Rystad Energy .

0904 ET - Norfolk Southern has tapped Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw as its next CEO, who will assume the role from Jim Squires in May. Shaw, who will be taking on the role of president immediately, is well-known to Wall Street, appearing on earnings calls to discuss market conditions in the railroad industry. As freight railroads continue to push forward efficiency and cost-cutting plans, the appointment of a sales-minded CEO appears as a logical step, as the railroads try to convince shippers to put more of their product on the rails. Norfolk Southern also elevated an internal executive, Ed Elkins, to fill Shaw's role as CMO. Elkins has been vice president of industrial products. (paul.ziobro@wsj.com; @pziobro)

The retailer currently has around 44 pOpshelf locations, 30 as stand alone stores and 14 that are integrated into existing Dollar General stores. (sarah.nassauer@wsj.com)

0808 ET - China's move toward recertifying the 737 MAX is key for Boeing 's production plan, but it still needs the rest of the Asian market to recover in terms of passenger traffic. Boeing 's delivered 185 of the jets this year, none of them to the region beyond three that went to Fiji Airways and a handful to lessors including China's ICBC and CDB. Boeing is on track to deliver around 230 of the jets worldwide this year. That's a fraction of the roughly 2,000 analysts had expected to be delivered from 2019 to 2021, before the March 2019 grounding. Boeing shares recently up 5% in pre open trade.

0520 ET - Sustainability will only grow in importance for fashion brands next year, as they look to win over consumers and attract and retain talented employees, McKinsey says in its State of Fashion 2022 report, written with the Business of Fashion trade publication. With only around 10% of the global textile market currently composed of recycled materials, industrywide investment will have to step up to provide the higher-grade technology needed to close fabric loops and lessen the impact on the environment. As well as boosting brands' environmental credentials among consumers, sustainability is also increasingly vital for attracting and keeping staff talent, the report says. ""[E]mployees today want their employers to reflect their values and offer a sense of purpose,"" it notes. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0518 ET - Supply problems pose a threat to fashion's likely rapid recovery beyond pre-pandemic profit levels next year, and could entail long-lasting price increases for consumers, McKinsey says in its State of Fashion 2022 report alongside trade publication the Business of Fashion. A vast majority of fashion executives polled by the report's authors expect supply-chain disruption to drag margins next year, with material shortages, transportation bottlenecks and higher shipping expenses increasing costs across the industry. The resultant supply-demand imbalance will entail price increases that could endure into the longer term, the report says. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0439 ET - Apple should be able to report an increase in sales in its fiscal first quarter despite news that demand for its iPhone 13 line-up has weakened, Equita Sim says, citing a report from Bloomberg that Apple informed its component suppliers of the slowdown. Apple ""is still on track for a record holiday season, with consensus projecting a sales increase of 6% to $117.9 billion in the final three months of the calendar year, although it won't be the blockbuster quarter that Apple had originally envisioned,"" Equita Sim says. Apple had posted sales of $111.44 billion in the three months ended Dec. 26, 2020, with the iPhone accounting for $65.60 billion of the total. (mauro.orru@wsj.com; @MauroOrru94)

A vast majority of fashion executives polled by the report's authors expect supply-chain disruption to drag margins next year, with material shortages, transportation bottlenecks and higher shipping expenses increasing costs across the industry. The resultant supply-demand imbalance will entail price increases that could endure into the longer term, the report says. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0439 ET - Apple should be able to report an increase in sales in its fiscal first quarter despite news that demand for its iPhone 13 line-up has weakened, Equita Sim says, citing a report from Bloomberg that Apple informed its component suppliers of the slowdown. Apple ""is still on track for a record holiday season, with consensus projecting a sales increase of 6% to $117.9 billion in the final three months of the calendar year, although it won't be the blockbuster quarter that Apple had originally envisioned,"" Equita Sim says. Apple had posted sales of $111.44 billion in the three months ended Dec. 26, 2020, with the iPhone accounting for $65.60 billion of the total. (mauro.orru@wsj.com; @MauroOrru94)

0434 ET - The metaverse could be a lucrative new frontier for fashion businesses, with the burgeoning gaming industry offering access to younger consumers, McKinsey says in its State of Fashion 2022 report alongside trade publication the Business of Fashion. The metaverse, which brings together virtual worlds, can help brands monetize their digital products, such as by creating nonfungible tokens, the report says. The global gaming industry could reach a value of $219 billion by 2024 and is a promising area of growth for fashion brands, while social shopping is also a channel of growing importance, it adds.

0432 ET - Next year ""will be a crucial year for the fashion grow,"" as the industry struggles to return to profit after the destructive effects of the global coronavirus pandemic, McKinsey says in its State of Fashion 2022 report alongside trade publication the Business of Fashion. Global fashion sales should be 3%-8% higher in 2022 than in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, according to the report. This 'V-shaped' recovery will be driven by China and the U.S., with Europe continuing to lag, it adds. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

0333 ET - The dollar inches higher as concerns about the new omicron coronavirus variant dominate, leaving limited effect from the prospect of faster monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve for now. However, the dollar should strengthen by the beginning of next year as monetary policy takes center stage, MUFG says. ""We expect the Fed to continue to tighten policy. It leaves room for U.S. rates and the U.S. dollar to rise further at the start of next year,"" currency analyst Lee Hardman says. Comments this week from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell ""provided strong guidance"" that the pace of asset-purchase tapering would be speeded up, potentially allowing interest rates to rise sooner, Hardman says. The DXY dollar index edges up 0.1% to 96.0810. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)

0508 ET - Current market sentiment around Sanofi is poor due to negative perceptions of its drug pipeline and its upcoming breast-cancer drug amcenestran, which are unjustified, Citi says. The French pharma major's flu business is also perceived as under threat from mRNA technology, and that Sanofi 's own efforts in mRNA vaccines have little value, the U.S. bank says. However, Sanofi has explained that the threat from mRNA competition has been overblown, Citi says, adding that it is expected to see improved sentiment and upward revisions for its vaccine business. In 2022, the company's shares are seen better reflecting the earnings power of its best-seller Dupixent, and a more balanced view on its vaccine business should arise, also in view of Sanofi 's role in the mRNA field, Citi says.

1844 ET--Cancer victims who blame Johnson & Johnson 's talc-based baby powder for their disease asked for the dismissal of chapter 11 proceedings the company filed, in an effort to drive a settlement. A committee of injury claimants say J&J's decision to place talc-related liabilities into bankruptcy was meant only to shield assets and avoid jury trials, which isn't what chapter 11 is for. J&J has said the bankruptcy by its LTL Management LLC subsidiary was designed to facilitate a fair settlement and avoid wasteful spending on nearly 40,000 talc-related injury lawsuits filed around the country. Talc claimants disagree, saying J&J is exploiting legal protections meant for ""honest but unfortunate"" businesses. ""The world is watching this case,"" they said in Wednesday's filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J. J&J maintains its talc products are safe and don't cause cancer. A hearing on the dismissal request is set for mid-February. ( andrew.scurria@wsj.com )

OUTLOOK

Newmont's outlook reflects increasing gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects. Outlook includes current development capital costs and production related to Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides, Pamour at Porcupine and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1.

Newmont's 2022 outlook assumes an $1,800 per ounce revenue gold price for CAS and AISC to reflect higher costs from inflation, royalties and production taxes. In 2022, an additional 5% of cost escalation is incorporated into our direct operating costs related to labor, energy, and material and supplies. 2022 and longer-term outlook assumes a $30 per ounce impact from production taxes and royalties attributable to higher gold prices. Outlook assumes operations continue without major Covid-related interruptions. Newmont continues to maintain wide-ranging protective measures for its workforce and neighboring communities, including screening, physical distancing, deep cleaning and avoiding exposure for at-risk individuals, which are expected to impact AISC per gold equivalent ounce by approximately $10 per ounce. If at any point the Company determines that continuing operations poses an increased risk to our workforce or host communities, it will reduce operational activities up to, and including, care and maintenance and management of critical environmental systems.

Please see the cautionary statement and footnotes for additional information.

Attributable gold production is expected to be stable at 6.0 to 6.8 million ounces across the five-year period. The 2022 outlook of 6.2 million ounces increases from 2021 due to increased production at Boddington and Ahafo. Production is expected to remain between 6.0 and 6.6 million ounces in 2023. This is supported by a steady base from our world class assets, and is further enhanced by the Company's other operating mines and our ownership in Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo joint ventures. In 2024, production is expected to increase to between 6.2 and 6.8 million ounces longer-term through 2026 due to the inclusion of profitable production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2 and reaching higher gold grade at Peñasquito.

Costs are expected to improve throughout the five-year period with investments in profitable projects and benefits from Full Potential improvements. 2022 CAS is expected to be $820 per ounce and improve to between $740 and $840 per ounce for 2023 and $700 and $800 per ounce in 2024 through 2026. AISC is expected to improve to between $980 and $1,080 per ounce in 2023 and $920 to $1,020 per ounce longer-term through 2026.

In 2022, Boddington increases production with higher copper grade, with steady production expected at Peñasquito. In the longer-term, higher co-product production from Peñasquito is expected due to higher silver, lead and zinc content delivered from the Chile Colorado pit, which is partially offset by decreasing copper production from Boddington due to mine sequencing. First copper production is expected from Yanacocha Sulfides in 2026.

Peñasquito is expected to deliver lower gold production in 2022 due to lower-grade, harder ore mined from the Chile Colorado pit and stripping the next phases of the Peñasco and Chile Colorado pits continuing through 2023. Co-product production at Peñasquito in 2022 is expected to remain consistent with 2021 production levels, with increased production starting in 2023 due to higher silver, lead and zinc content delivered from the Chile Colorado pit. Porcupine benefits from higher grades at Hoyle, Borden and Hollinger in 2022. The Pamour project is expected to maintain production at Porcupine in 2024 as Hollinger and Hoyle begin to ramp down in 2023 and 2025, respectively. Éléonore, CC&V and Musselwhite are expected to deliver steady production in 2022.

Unit costs at Peñasquito are expected to be impacted by lower production in 2022 and 2023. Porcupine unit costs benefit from higher production in 2022. Unit costs at Éléonore, CC&V and Musselwhite are expected to remain steady in 2022.

Merian is expected to deliver higher production from higher grade in 2022, with slightly lower production expected in subsequent years as we enter the next phase of stripping in the Merian pit and continue mining harder, higher-grade ore. Cerro Negro production is expected to steadily increase due to higher throughput and development rates from productivity improvements. The first expansion at Cerro Negro includes the development of the Marianas and Eastern districts, adding production starting in 2024. Yanacocha continues to deliver leach-only production while developing the first phase of the Sulfides project.

Unit costs at Merian benefit from higher production in 2022 and increase starting in 2023 due to mine sequencing. Cerro Negro unit costs are expected to steadily improve due to higher production. Costs are expected to be higher at Yanacocha through 2024 until the transition to Sulfides.

Production at Boddington benefits from higher gold and copper grades and efficiency improvements from Autonomous Haulage in 2022. Gold production is expected to decrease in 2023 as the site is expanding the North and South pits through laybacks and remain steady longer-term due to continued throughput from strong mill performance. Tanami maintains steady production through 2023, with higher production beginning in 2024 from the ramp-up of Tanami Expansion 2.

Unit costs at Boddington and Tanami are expected to remain steady, driven largely by production volumes and improved underground efficiencies at Tanami as the second expansion comes online.

2 Dec 2021 07:00 ET 
Press Release: Newmont Provides 2022 and -3-

The 2022 outlook for general and administrative costs remains flat at $260 million. Interest expense decreases to $225 million in 2022 due primarily to the capitalization of interest on development capital spend. Depreciation and amortization remains flat at $2.3 billion with steady production. The adjusted tax rate is decreasing to 30-34% due to higher production in favorable tax jurisdictions at a higher metal price assumption.

Assumptions and Sensitivities

Newmont's outlook assumes an $1,800 per ounce gold price, $3.25 per pound copper price, $23.00 per ounce silver price, $1.15 per pound zinc price, $0.95 per pound lead price, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate, $0.80 USD/CAD exchange rate and $60 per barrel WTI oil price.

Assuming a 35% incremental tax rate, an $100 per ounce increase in gold price would deliver an expected $400 million improvement in attributable free cash flow. Included within the attributable free cash flow sensitivity is a royalty and production tax impact of $5 per ounce for every $100 per ounce change in gold price.

PROJECTS UPDATE(3)

Newmont's project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine life. Outlook includes current development capital, costs and production related to Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1. Additional projects not listed below represent incremental improvements to the Company's outlook. 


   -- Tanami Expansion 2 (Australia) secures Tanami's future as a long-life, 
      low-cost producer with potential to extend mine life beyond 2040 through 
      the addition of a 1,460 meter hoisting shaft and supporting 
      infrastructure to process 3.3 million tonnes per year and provide a 
      platform for future growth. The expansion is expected to increase average 
      annual gold production by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per 
      year for the first five years and is expected to reduce operating costs 
      by approximately 10 percent. Capital costs for the project are estimated 
      to be between $850 and $950 million with a commercial production date in 
      2024. 
 
   -- Ahafo North (Africa) expands our existing footprint in Ghana with four 
      open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers 
      from the Company's Ahafo South operations. The project is expected to add 
      between 275,000 and 325,000 ounces per year with all-in sustaining costs 
      between $600 to $700 per ounce for the first five full years of 
      production (2024-2028). Capital costs for the project are estimated to be 
      between $750 and $850 million with a construction completion date in late 
      2023 and commercial production in 2024. Ahafo North is the best unmined 
      gold deposit in West Africa with approximately 3.5 million ounces of 
      Reserves and more than 1 million ounces of Measured and Indicated and 
      Inferred Resource and significant upside potential to extend beyond Ahafo 
      North's current 13-year mine life. 
 
   -- Yanacocha Sulfides (South America)4 will develop the first phase of 
      sulfide deposits and an integrated processing circuit, including an 
      autoclave to produce 45% gold, 45% copper and 10% silver. The project is 
      expected to add average annual production of 525,000 gold equivalent 
      ounces per year with all-in sustaining costs between $700 and $800 per 
      ounce for the first five full years of production (2027-2031). An 
      investment decision is expected in the second half of 2022 with a three 
      year development period. The first phase focuses on developing the 
      Yanacocha Verde and Chaquicocha deposits to extend Yanacocha's operations 
      beyond 2040 with second and third phases having the potential to extend 
      life for multiple decades. 
 
   -- Pamour (North America) extends the life of Porcupine and maintains 
      production beginning in 2024. The project will optimize mill capacity, 
      adding volume and supporting high grade ore from Borden and Hoyle Pond, 
      while supporting further exploration in a highly prospective and proven 
      mining district. An investment decision is expected in the second half of 
      2022 with estimated capital costs between $350 and $450 million. 
 
   -- Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 (South America) includes the 
      simultaneous development of the Marianas and Eastern districts to extend 
      the mine life of Cerro Negro beyond 2030. The project is expected to 
      improve production to above 350,000 ounces beginning in 2024, while 
      improving all-in sustaining costs to between $800 and $900 per ounce. 
      Capital costs for the project are estimated to be approximately $300 
      million. This project provides a platform for further exploration and 
      future growth through additional expansions. 
 
(1) The adjusted tax rate excludes certain items such as tax valuation 
allowance adjustments. 
(2) Assuming average prices of $1,800 per ounce for gold, $3.25 per pound for 
copper, $23.00 per ounce for silver, $0.95 per pound for lead, and $1.15 per 
pound for zinc and achievement of current production and sales volumes and 
cost estimates, we estimate our consolidated adjusted effective tax rate 
related to continuing operations for 2022 will be between 30%-34%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

All-In Sustaining Costs

Newmont has developed a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.

Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.

All-in sustaining cost (""AISC"") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company's internal policies.

The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:

Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales (""CAS""), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals at our Peñasquito and Boddington mines. The other metals CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 3 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito and Boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the

Press Release: Newmont Provides 2022 and -5-

period.

Reclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost (""ARC"") for the Company's operating properties. Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito and Boddington mines.

Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito and Boddington mines. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.

General and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to supporting our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. We allocate these costs to gold and other metals at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.

Care and maintenance and Other expense, net. Care and maintenance includes direct operating costs incurred at the mine sites during the period that these sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For Other expense, net we exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company's non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito and Boddington mines. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.

Treatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito and Boddington mines.

Sustaining capital and finance lease payments. We determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. We determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of AISC. The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito and Boddington mines. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.

However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition; and often contain words such as ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan, "" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""believe,"" ""target,"" ""indicative,"" ""preliminary,"" or ""potential."" Forward-looking statements in this news release may include, without limitation: (i) estimates of future production and sales, including production outlook, average future production, upside potential and indicative production profiles; (ii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales and all-in sustaining costs; (iii) estimates of future capital expenditures, including development and sustaining capital; (iv) estimates of future cost reductions, full potential savings, value creation, improvements, synergies and efficiencies; (v) expectations regarding the Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 projects, as well as the development, growth and exploration potential of the Company's other operations, projects and investments, including, without limitation, returns, IRR, schedule, approval and decision dates, mine life and mine life extensions, commercial start, first production, average production, average costs, impacts of improvement or expansion projects and upside potential; (vi) expectations regarding future investments or divestitures; (vii) expectations regarding free cash flow, and returns to stockholders, including with respect to future dividends and future share repurchases; (viii) expectations regarding future mineralization, including, without limitation, expectations regarding reserves and recoveries; (ix) estimates of future closure costs and liabilities, including, without limitation, expectations with respect to water treatment and other costs; (x) expectations regarding the timing and/or likelihood of future borrowing, future debt repayment, financial flexibility and cash flow; and (xi) expectations regarding the impact of the Covid-19 and variants thereof; (xii) expectations regarding the outcome of the strategic alliance with Caterpillar , future development of new equipment and technologies, and achievement of related goals, including, without limitation, GHG reduction targets, targets for CC&V and Tanami and related timelines; and (xiii) expectations related to other energy and climate investments and achievement of targets.

Investors are reminded that future dividends beyond the dividend payable on December 28, 2021 to holders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2021 have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors, and an annualized dividend payout or dividend yield has not been declared by the Board. Management's expectations with respect to future dividends are ""forward-looking statements"" and the Company's dividend framework is non-binding. The declaration and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be determined based on Newmont's financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, gold and commodity prices and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Investors are also cautioned that the extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including trading volume, market conditions, legal requirements, business conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors that might impact future looking statements, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, each filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), under the heading ""Risk Factors"", available on the SEC website or www.newmont.com. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any ""forward-looking statement,"" including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued ""forward-looking statement"" constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on ""forward-looking statements"" is at investors' own risk.

Notice for U.S. Investors:

The terms ""resources"" and ""Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources"" are used in this news release. Investors are advised that the SEC does not recognize these terms and ""resources"" have not been prepared in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Newmont has determined that such ""resources"" would be substantively the same as those prepared using the Guidelines established by the Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME) and defined as ""Mineral Resource"". Estimates of resources are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be given that they will eventually convert to future reserves. Inferred Resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the Inferred Resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. Investors are reminded that even if significant mineralization is discovered and converted to reserves, during the time necessary to ultimately move such mineralization to production the economic feasibility of production may change. US investors are encouraged to refer to the ""Proven and Probable Reserve"" tables contained herein for reserves prepared in compliance with the SEC's Industry Guide 7 and ""Mineralized Material"" tables, available at www.newmont.com and included in the Company's Form 10-K, filed on February 18, 2021, on www.sec.gov. Additional information on the Company's resource estimates can be found at www.newmont.com/operations-and-projects/reserves-and-resources.

1208 ET - Although Mexico's inflation came in higher-than-expected at 7.37% in November, the Bank of Mexico will probably maintain its pace of interest-rate increases at 25bp at the Dec. 16 meeting, says Barclays . ""Although recent upside surprises on inflation could add risks of a more aggressive action, i.e., a 50bp hike, we do not think these numbers are enough to see the majority of the board voting for it."" Some negative base effects, and higher volatile fresh fruit and vegetable prices contributed to the rise in the annual rate last month, while the upside surprise in core CPI to 5.67% was less pronounced, Barclays adds, raising its year-end CPI forecast to 7.5% from 7.4% and leaving its core estimate at 5.6%.

1207 ET - Wacker Chemie 's share price has declined 17% in roughly two weeks, as spot-market polysilicon prices fell and doubts were cast on the sustainability of the company's earnings strength for the fourth quarter, Baader Helvea says. The German chemical company might continue to be affected by falling spot-market prices in December as demand eases due to seasonal reasons, the German equity research firm says. However the market is too negative on the company's prospects for 2022 and there should be a significant consensus upward revision ahead, Baader says. The upcoming Dec. 16 capital markets day is also seen as a positive trigger for Wacker's stock, it adds. Wacker Chemie shares trade up 0.3% at EUR145.35. (cecilia.butini@wsj.com)

1157 ET - Everyone who got into crypto in the last two years has only seen a bull market in crypto, and the entire crypto market even back to the launch of bitcoin has only happened in the bull market for equities after the global financial crisis, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton business school. ""While I'm not predicting any specific timing, we have seen time and time again 80% corrections in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies,"" he says, noting that there's no reason to believe volatility has gone away and a crypto shakeout is bound to occur at some point.

1152 ET - The plans to label gas investment as green would undermine the value of the European Union 's green finance rules, says nonprofit campaign group Transport & Environment . The EU is likely to share its plan late this month for how natural-gas and nuclear energy would be classified under its new green investment rules, a long-awaited decision that has countries and investors divided. While some argue that fossil fuels and nuclear are needed to help the bloc reach its emissions targets, others say recognizing their role in the climate transition doesn't make them green. Labeling gas as green would ""destroy the credibility of the EU 's sustainable finance agenda as a whole,"" Transport & Environment 's Luca Bonaccorsi says. (maitane.sardon@wsj.com)

1140 ET - Inditex 's margins are likely to come under pressure next year and further ahead, with the Spanish fashion retailer's new management facing a number of challenges, Credit Suisse says. Inditex 's gross margin is likely to fall 85 basis points next year while the operating margin should stay static, with consensus expectations for significant increases ""very optimistic,"" CS says. Fresh management, including new CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras and founder's daughter Marta Ortega Perez who will start as chairwoman in April, will have to confront various headwinds, including falling store space, challenges to smaller brands, stiffer retail competition and a demanding sustainability agenda, the Swiss Bank says. ""Shares look expensive relative to modest growth prospects,"" it adds. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

1140 ET - CVS Health says it aims to add 250 to 350 primary-care centers to its operations as part of a plan to expand its medical offerings. The company said last month that it needs doctors on its payroll to fulfill long-held ambitions of becoming a major provider of healthcare services. Acquiring clinics rather than recruiting physicians is part of CVS's strategy to grow the business amid a shortage of primary care doctors, says Alan Lotvin , executive vice president of CVS Health. He also says the company would consider acquiring a home-health company to expand its business of providing medical care at home. CVS gains 4.1% to $96.98. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1122 ET - Morgan Stanley expects infrastructure spending to boost nonresidential construction stocks, particularly United Rentals . ""Even after embedding more conservative outperformance assumptions, we expect URI to benefit from an underlying recovery in US Non-Resi spending - our FY22 revenue estimates now stand 1% ahead of consensus."" The firm says the potential upside ""is not appropriately calibrated for 2023+"" for the equipment rental company. ""As investors begin to calibrate 2023 estimates and potential upside, we would expect upward pressure on '23 estimates as infrastructure spending begins to materialize more meaningfully."" Morgan Stanley raises its price target to $395 from $297. United Rentals is stable at $357. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1111 ET - European stocks fall, with travel-related companies among the biggest losers as investors eye the possibility of stricter coronavirus restrictions. The Stoxx Europe 600 and CAC 40 drop 0.1% and the DAX 40 and FTSE 100 are down 0.3%. Brent crude subsides 0.8% to $75.21 a barrel. The Dow falls 0.1%. ""It's been a cautious session for markets in Europe, with investors becoming ever more reticent heading towards the weekend and tomorrow's U.S. CPI report for November,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson says. ""The risk of tighter restrictions due to Omicron appears to be tempering risk appetite, after the early gains of this week."" (philip.waller@wsj.com)

1108 ET - House-price inflation in the U.K. appears to have found a fresh impetus despite the withdrawal of the stamp-duty property-tax holiday in the form of a lack of supply, Davy Research says. Inflation has risen to be 8.2% and 10%, respectively, according to fresh Halifax and Nationwide data, and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyor's report notes that agreed sales have been held back by a lack of stock, in contrast to a rise in new buyer enquiries in November, the Irish research firm says. ""The Halifax index for November rose by 1% on the month, with the average price increasing to GBP273,000 and with annual inflation accelerating to 8.2%,"" Davy says. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

1056 ET - 2021 was really the year that crypto and digital assets became normalized, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at Wharton. Coinbase 's roughly $80B IPO this year was the ""first huge, major IPO of a crypto firm in the US,"" but the normalization was also supported by platforms like Square or Robinhood, he says. Ordinary retail investors are now starting to trade in something like bitcoin and ""starting to perceive (it) as not fundamentally different from investing in other kinds of asset classes."" About half of the crypto traders in the US got into the market in the last year, he says, and the numbers are significant, with 50 to 100M accounts in the US on crypto trading platforms and 200M to 300M worldwide.

1244 ET - Labcorp says that after a strategic review, it plans to introduce a dividend in 2Q, keeping other aspects of its structure intact. The results of the review aren't surprising, Mizuho says, but the firm adds that the dividend could help Labcorp close a valuation gap with competitor Quest Diagnostics , which already pays a dividend to its shareholders. Over the last five years, Labcorp has traded at a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio than Quest.

J&J subsidiary LTL Management LLC wants Jones Day to represent it in a bankruptcy case it filed earlier this year to resolve personal injury lawsuits alleging J&J talc products caused cancer or other injuries, which the company denies. US Trustee Andrew R. Vara said in an objection in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey that Jones Day could have professional conflicts because the firm has represented the parent company, J&J, and a former corporate affiliate on restructuring matters related to talc liabilities. Companies that file chapter 11 must get approval from a bankruptcy judge for the law firms they retain to represent them. A J&J spokeswoman declined comment. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 09, 2021-- 

Citi has today announced the expansion of its Cross-Currency Sweeps cash management solution across several European markets.

The solution, Citi Cross-Currency Sweeps, enables treasurers and finance teams to efficiently manage cash positions across multiple accounts, countries, and currencies, using one streamlined and automated solution.

Leveraging Citi's global cash concentration network and foreign exchange (FX) capabilities, it helps companies manage FX and cash positions and immediately convert available liquidity into the currency of their choice.

The solution is now available in an additional 14 countries across Europe including Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, and Austria.

""Our corporate clients are increasingly moving through a Digital Transformation journey for their Treasury and FX Risk Management,"" says Sam Hewson, Global Head of eFX Solutions and EMEA Head of Corporate Sales. ""As technology has evolved, we are helping our clients to automate processes, using efficient, integrated and seamless strategies to provide transparent liquidity and FX activities. Citi Cross-Currency Sweeps brings together the power of our liquidity and FX technologies to help our clients automate their day-to-day activities, so that they can stay focused on creating smart treasuries of the future, today.""

The tool addresses a wide range of cash management needs, making it easier for companies to fund accounts when and where balances are needed and to achieve optimized liquidity across their global banking structure.

Enabling the automation of FX dealings in a variety of major and exotic currency pairs, Citi Cross-Currency Sweeps allows treasurers to move funds seamlessly across the Citi network. Accounts in local currencies do not need to be pre-funded and companies can seek to realize same-day settlement of funds in the desired currency, on an intraday basis.

""Citi Cross-Currency Sweeps provides significant potential to enhance the way treasurers manage liquidity,"" says Stephen Randall, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. ""Managing liquidity in multiple currencies is often a manual process, with significant time taken up by forecasting, FX management and the movement of cash between accounts. Process inefficiencies can lead to excess cash buffers and operational challenges. This solution automates and streamlines multiple steps into one, helping clients optimize both efficiency and liquidity.""

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 9, 2021--S&P Global Ratings today said that 
Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings 's (LabCorp ; BBB/Stable/--) plans to 
initiate a quarterly dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and the 
authorization of a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program does not affect 
our credit quality assessment of the company at this time. We had anticipated 
that LabCorp  would utilize some of its large cash balance and strong cash flow 
generation for sizeable share buybacks. We expect the dividend payments to 
amount to about $250 million-$300 million annually. 
 
Our issuer credit rating remains 'BBB', with a stable outlook on LabCorp  
reflect our view that once the large benefits to the company from the pandemic 
subside, credit metrics will return closer to pre-pandemic levels. We expect 
the laboratory reimbursement environment to remain relatively stable, and the 
company's substantial scale and superior operating efficiency leave it better 
positioned to weather reimbursement cuts, relative to smaller laboratory 
services providers. It also reflects our view the company will continue to 
benefit from above-GDP growth in demand for contract research services. Based 
on these factors, we expect LabCorp  will generate substantial free operating 
cash flow, but that it will also remain aggressive with acquisitions and share 
buybacks such that leverage will migrate back to our long-term expectation of 
at or above 3x. 
 
This report does not constitute a rating action.

(NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of data, technology, and market infrastructure, today announced that it plans to launch its first ethylene futures contracts on December 13.

Designed for participants who need to manage their exposure to ethylene price risk from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia, the two cash settled futures contracts are based on ethylene price assessments by ICIS. The ICIS CFR NE (northeast) Asia ethylene assessment and the ICIS CFR SE (southeast) Asia ethylene assessment are quoted on a cost and freight (CFR) basis per metric ton of ethylene for delivery.

""These new contracts will provide a direct hedge for the market to manage its ethylene exposure on the water from the Gulf Coast to Asia,"" said J.C. Kneale, Vice President, North American Gas and Power at ICE . ""There is tremendous demand from Asia for these contracts given the role ethylene plays in the plastics and packaging manufacturing industry.""

Ethylene is considered to be amongst the most important and widely used petrochemical components. It is one of the key ingredients to make plastic, PVC, polyethylene, and ethylene glycol used in polyester and antifreeze. Polyethylene is estimated to account for more than half of global ethylene demand and is used to make packaging, trash can liners, as well as coating paper and cardboard.

""With its new ethylene export capacity, the US is now a significant player in the global ethylene market. Our petrochemicals team in North America and Asia is immensely pleased to be working with ICE to provide end-to-end hedging solutions in this space,"" said Mark Quiner, Head of Petrochemicals at Marex. ""We share ICE 's focus on derivatizing petrochemicals in the U.S. as it allows us both to offer our clients international vertical hedging solutions from the well-head all the way to the end of the barrel.""

""Ethylene is the starting point for so many consumer and industrial goods that impact our daily lives,"" said Anne-Sophie Purtell, Regional Head of Sales, Greater Asia at ICIS. ""The decision to launch the futures contracts shows the increased sophistication of the market. ICIS price assessments are referenced throughout the world and represent an industry reference point. We are delighted that ICE 's Asia ethylene futures contracts will be settled on ICIS price assessments.""

The new ethylene contracts will trade alongside ICE 's existing Gulf Coast ethylene contract, the Ethylene, OPIS PCW Mont Belvieu future (ICE: ETH), and the contracts which hedge the feedstocks to make ethylene including the ICE Ethane, OPIS Mt. Belvieu Non-TET future and option contracts (ICE: ETE).

In addition, ICE plans to launch its first Asia Propylene contracts on January 10, which will be the Propylene ICIS CFR NE Asia Future and the Propylene ICIS CFR SE Asia future. Propylene is the raw material to produce polypropylene, a widely produced commodity plastic, with applications in many household items, clothing, and other consumer products.

CEO Toby Rice on Monday replied to Ms. Warren in a corker of a letter that deserves wider circulation. Although not on the American left's most-wanted list, at least not yet, EQT is the largest U.S. natural gas producer and has an enormous footprint in the Appalachian shale basin.

Mr. Rice notes that the average price of natural gas for 2021 ($4.80 per mcf or thousand cubic feet) is significantly below the 20-year average of $5.70 mcf. Between 2005 and 2008, before the U.S. shale drilling boom for natural gas, prices roughly ranged between $6 and $13 mcf. ""Yes, the price of natural gas has increased rapidly relative to 2020 as the economic engines of the world have reignited, but natural gas prices in 2020 were the lowest in over two decades, a year during which we exported LNG,"" he writes.

U.S. LNG exports have been increasing rapidly since 2015 and doubled in the last two years due to rising global demand for the fuel to replace coal. But LNG exports still account for only about 10% of U.S. production. Prices are lower than during most of President Obama's first term when LNG exports were basically nonexistent.

Exports have encouraged more production, which has helped keep prices low for Americans. Lower gas prices have filtered through to consumers in lower electricity rates and have offset the steep cost of integrating solar and wind into the electricity grid. Americans would be paying much more for electricity today without the past decade's boom in shale hydraulic fracturing.

LNG exports are also reducing global CO2 emissions. Mr. Rice calculates that switching from coal to gas power in the U.S. has reduced CO2 emissions by the equivalent of electrifying 190 million cars, or roughly 70% of the total number of cars in the U.S. Unlike electric vehicles, natural gas doesn't require hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies.

""The United States has a vast amount of natural gas, more than any other country in the world,"" Mr. Rice concludes. ""To best address climate change, it is incumbent on countries like the United States to produce more natural gas that can be used by other countries."" If the U.S. doesn't, Vladimir Putin has made clear that Russia will, increasing his energy leverage over Europe.

Natural gas prices have increased this year because supply hasn't kept up with demand. The Democratic tax-and-regulatory onslaught on fossil fuels and pressure from progressive investors have persuaded some producers to restrain output and return profits to shareholders rather than invest in expanding supply.

The Biden Administration this week has been pointing to a recent dip in energy prices triggered by the Omicron Covid variant and a milder winter weather forecast. Democrats want to take credit for falling prices that have nothing to do with their policies while ducking political responsibility for price increases that their policies lead to.

The executive committee will report to Joaquin Duato when he succeeds Gorsky as CEO Jan. 3. J&J is making the leadership changes while it's also preparing to separate its consumer-health unit into a standalone company. (peter.loftus@wsj.com, @Loftus)

Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the $750 million 3.25% senior unsecured notes issued by KKR Group Finance Co. X LLC, an indirect subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc . (A/Stable) due Dec. 15, 2051.

The assignment of the final ratings follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final ratings are the same as the expected rating assigned to the unsecured notes on Dec. 1, 2021; see ""Fitch Expects to Rate KKR 's Unsecured Debt 'A'"" at www.fitchratings.com.

Key Rating Drivers

SUBSIDIARY RATING AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT

The debt rating is equalized with KKR 's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting its fully unsecured funding profile. The rating also reflects that the notes rank equally with existing and future senior unsecured notes issued by KKR , and joint and several guarantees by KKR and its subsidiary, KKR Group Partnership L.P., which collects all of the firm's revenues.

Leverage remains within Fitch's 'a' category quantitative capitalization and leverage benchmark range when assessed using the agency's hybrid leverage approach, given KKR 's cash generative business model and heavy balance sheet utilization. KKR 's ratings incorporate an expectation that cash flow leverage may remain above the peer average and Fitch's quantitative benchmark range of 0.5x-2.5x for 'A' category alternative investment managers (IM), which is mitigated by the firm's low balance sheet leverage. KKR 's debt to fee-related FEBITDA was 2.8x for the TTM ended 3Q21 (3.2x on a pro forma basis) and debt to tangible equity was 0.2x at 3Q21 (actual and pro forma).

KKR 's ratings reflect its strong competitive position as a global alternative IM, experienced management team, large institutional investor base, solid investment track record, strong fundraising capabilities, relatively predictable fee-earnings stream given sizable fee-earning assets under management (FAUM), carry-generating capabilities, solid liquidity and a below-average payout ratio.

Rating constraints include key-person risk, which is institutionalized throughout many limited partnership (LP) agreements; reputational risk, which can affect the company's ability to raise funds; and legal, political and regulatory risk, which could alter the alternative asset industry. Rating constraints specific to KKR include its sizeable balance sheet, which exposes the capital base to potential valuation declines and higher cash flow leverage, which is somewhat offset by relatively low balance sheet leverage.

KKR's Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the firm will continue to generate consistent management fees and FEBITDA, grow FAUM through follow-on funds and expansion into new products, manage cash flow leverage down over time with the generation of incremental fees, and maintain solid balance sheet leverage and liquidity. The Stable Outlook incorporates an expectation that cash flow leverage may remain above the peer average and Fitch's general tolerance level for 'a' category rated alternative IMs, offset by the company's low balance sheet leverage and strong liquidity profile.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT

The unsecured debt rating is linked to the IDR and is expected to move in tandem. However, a meaningful decline in the amount of unsecured debt in the capital structure, in favor of secured borrowings, could result in the unsecured debt rating being notched down from the IDR.

Finance Co. X's ratings are equalized with KKR and are, therefore, expected to move in tandem with ratings of the holding company.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade include an increase in fund and fee diversity, growth in permanent capital under management which would enhance the predictability of management fees, a decline in the proportionate contribution of transaction and monitoring fees to total fees, as they tend to be more volatile/cyclical, increased stability in balance sheet earnings and a sustained reduction in cash flow leverage.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade include declines in investment performance which negatively impact the company's ability to raise FAUM and generate fees, sustained meaningful increases in cash flow or balance sheet leverage, such that these metrics exceed 2.5x and 0.3x, respectively, under Fitch's hybrid leverage analysis, meaningful balance sheet asset impairment, and/or a material reduction of the firm's liquidity profile.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

Fitch Ratings, Inc . is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the ""NRSRO""). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory  ), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the ""non-NRSROs"") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.

It's a reflection of not doing deals in recent years and cash building up, he tells analysts. ""We may still do a deal in '22,"" he says. (robert.wall@wsj.com)

1744 ET - Broadcom CEO Hock Tan says bookings, particularly from enterprise customers, remain at elevated levels. ""We're pretty much booked all the way through '22 and even beyond '22 into '23,"" he tells analysts. Broadcom jumps 6.7% after hours following the company's quarterly earnings and announcement of a share repurchase. (robert.wall@wsj.com)

1631 ET - Broadcom says it plans to buy back as much as $10B of its stock. The chip company had previously signaled that if it couldn't find a good M&A opportunity, it would find a way to reward investors with its cash. Talks for Broadcom to purchase SAS Institute ceased earlier this year. The share repurchase authorization runs through the end of next year. The buy back, announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings, lifts shares more than 5% in after-hours trading. (robert.wall@wsj.com)

1607 ET - US stocks are mostly lower as investors weigh historically low jobless claims data and restrictions world-wide to limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Weekly jobless claims fall to 184,000, the lowest level since 1969, a sign the labor market is recovering faster than expected. European governments are tightening restrictions and a study by a Japanese scientist says Omicron is four times more transmissible than Delta. Oil and gold prices slip while Treasury prices rise, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.49%. The Dow falls less than a point to 35754, the S&P 500 loses 0.7% to 4667 and the Nasdaq slips 1.7% to 15517. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1540 ET - US benchmark oil prices are falling further after the close of the NY trading session, with WTI crude now down 2.7% at $70.41. The extended decline in prices comes amid increasing jitters regarding the US and Iran, as The White House today says it is readying ""additional measures"" if nuclear talks fail. Sanctions are already in place to try to prevent Iran from exporting oil, and if the US were to make those sanctions stricter that could theoretically boost oil prices as global supplies would decline. That the market is moving lower on today's news may simply reflect risk aversion among some investors. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1448 ET - A Justice Department bankruptcy watchdog challenged a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary over its request to hire Jones Day for its chapter 11 case. J&J subsidiary LTL Management LLC wants Jones Day to represent it in a bankruptcy case it filed earlier this year to resolve personal injury lawsuits alleging J&J talc products caused cancer or other injuries, which the company denies. US Trustee Andrew R. Vara said in an objection in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey that Jones Day could have professional conflicts because the firm has represented the parent company, J&J, and a former corporate affiliate on restructuring matters related to talc liabilities. Companies that file chapter 11 must get approval from a bankruptcy judge for the law firms they retain to represent them. A J&J spokeswoman declined comment. (jonathan.randles@wsj.com)

1442 ET - US benchmark oil prices finish 2% lower at $70.94 a barrel, which brings to an end to a three-day rally that saw prices surge by 9%. Today's selling pressure came partly from a stronger dollar against its rivals, which often pressures crude prices lower since oil is bought and sold in greenbacks, while some geopolitical uncertainties are also having an impact. Yesterday's weekly EIA report also left investors with some bearish sentiment as it showed fuel inventories rising sharply, and saw US crude production hit another 19-month-high, at 11.7M bpd. Tomorrow's Baker Hughes rig count at 1 pm ET may draw more attention than normal now that output is rising. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1439 ET - GameStop disclosed in a securities filing yesterday that in late August the SEC issued it a subpoena calling for more documents concerning an investigation into trading activity of its shares and those of other companies. Previously, GameStop revealed it had received a request from the SEC in May for documents and information on the matter. ""This inquiry is not expected to adversely impact us,"" GameStop says in the new filing. In January, a social-media-fueled trading frenzy helped GameStop 's stock price skyrocket from the low teens to an intraday peak of $483. GameStop shares closed yesterday at $173.65, and they're off 11% following the release of its 3Q earnings, which showed the company grew revenue by 29% but also widened its loss to $105.4M from $18.8M a year earlier.

1252 ET - We will see enforcement actions and new rulemaking activity in 2022 addressing the regulatory issues around digital assets, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton business school. ""We're going to have action on stablecoins, over $100 billion of value is now in these stablecoins,"" which he says aren't subject to the same kinds of requirements that banks and money market funds are. ""There's no good reason why they shouldn't be, there's huge risk that they're not."" Regulatory moves and enforcement actions could come via legislation or other agencies, such as the SEC or the Treasury, he adds. Looking beyond the US, the Financial Action Task Force which is the global coordination body to combat money laundering is finalizing its rules for crypto anti money laundering, he says. (kavita.mokha@wsj.com)

1244 ET - Labcorp says that after a strategic review, it plans to introduce a dividend in 2Q, keeping other aspects of its structure intact. The results of the review aren't surprising, Mizuho says, but the firm adds that the dividend could help Labcorp close a valuation gap with competitor Quest Diagnostics , which already pays a dividend to its shareholders. Over the last five years, Labcorp has traded at a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio than Quest. ""We have always viewed LH's lack of dividend versus DGX as a key reason, given that LH has higher EPS growth of +28% versus DGX of +22%,"" Mizuho writes. Labcorp falls 3.5%. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)

1157 ET - Everyone who got into crypto in the last two years has only seen a bull market in crypto, and the entire crypto market even back to the launch of bitcoin has only happened in the bull market for equities after the global financial crisis, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton business school. ""While I'm not predicting any specific timing, we have seen time and time again 80% corrections in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies,"" he says, noting that there's no reason to believe volatility has gone away and a crypto shakeout is bound to occur at some point.

The four executives will lead corporate affairs, external innovation, pharmaceutical research and information technology. The current head of corporate affairs, Michael Sneed , will retire in April, joining the recently announced retirements of Alex Gorsky as CEO and Paul Stoffels as chief scientific officer.

Today's selling pressure came partly from a stronger dollar against its rivals, which often pressures crude prices lower since oil is bought and sold in greenbacks, while some geopolitical uncertainties are also having an impact. Yesterday's weekly EIA report also left investors with some bearish sentiment as it showed fuel inventories rising sharply, and saw US crude production hit another 19-month-high, at 11.7M bpd. Tomorrow's Baker Hughes rig count at 1 pm ET may draw more attention than normal now that output is rising. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1439 ET - GameStop disclosed in a securities filing yesterday that in late August the SEC issued it a subpoena calling for more documents concerning an investigation into trading activity of its shares and those of other companies. Previously, GameStop revealed it had received a request from the SEC in May for documents and information on the matter. ""This inquiry is not expected to adversely impact us,"" GameStop says in the new filing. In January, a social-media-fueled trading frenzy helped GameStop 's stock price skyrocket from the low teens to an intraday peak of $483. GameStop shares closed yesterday at $173.65, and they're off 11% following the release of its 3Q earnings, which showed the company grew revenue by 29% but also widened its loss to $105.4M from $18.8M a year earlier.

1252 ET - We will see enforcement actions and new rulemaking activity in 2022 addressing the regulatory issues around digital assets, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton business school. ""We're going to have action on stablecoins, over $100 billion of value is now in these stablecoins,"" which he says aren't subject to the same kinds of requirements that banks and money market funds are. ""There's no good reason why they shouldn't be, there's huge risk that they're not."" Regulatory moves and enforcement actions could come via legislation or other agencies, such as the SEC or the Treasury, he adds. Looking beyond the US, the Financial Action Task Force which is the global coordination body to combat money laundering is finalizing its rules for crypto anti money laundering, he says.

1244 ET - Labcorp says that after a strategic review, it plans to introduce a dividend in 2Q, keeping other aspects of its structure intact. The results of the review aren't surprising, Mizuho says, but the firm adds that the dividend could help Labcorp close a valuation gap with competitor Quest Diagnostics , which already pays a dividend to its shareholders. Over the last five years, Labcorp has traded at a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio than Quest. ""We have always viewed LH's lack of dividend versus DGX as a key reason, given that LH has higher EPS growth of +28% versus DGX of +22%,"" Mizuho writes. Labcorp falls 3.5%.

1157 ET - Everyone who got into crypto in the last two years has only seen a bull market in crypto, and the entire crypto market even back to the launch of bitcoin has only happened in the bull market for equities after the global financial crisis, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton business school. ""While I'm not predicting any specific timing, we have seen time and time again 80% corrections in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies,"" he says, noting that there's no reason to believe volatility has gone away and a crypto shakeout is bound to occur at some point.

1143 ET - The Fed could take markets by surprise at next week's meeting as it speeds up monetary tightening, deVere's Nigel Green says. ""The central bank will give several months' notice to the markets for a major policy shift. As such, if it is to maximize flexibility to raise rates, they will begin sooner rather than later, even as soon as next week."" Green expects turbulence to ensue, but he advises investors to ""embrace the volatility"" as a buying opportunity. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1140 ET - CVS Health says it aims to add 250 to 350 primary-care centers to its operations as part of a plan to expand its medical offerings. The company said last month that it needs doctors on its payroll to fulfill long-held ambitions of becoming a major provider of healthcare services. Acquiring clinics rather than recruiting physicians is part of CVS's strategy to grow the business amid a shortage of primary care doctors, says Alan Lotvin , executive vice president of CVS Health. He also says the company would consider acquiring a home-health company to expand its business of providing medical care at home. CVS gains 4.1% to $96.98. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1122 ET - Morgan Stanley expects infrastructure spending to boost nonresidential construction stocks, particularly United Rentals . ""Even after embedding more conservative outperformance assumptions, we expect URI to benefit from an underlying recovery in US Non-Resi spending - our FY22 revenue estimates now stand 1% ahead of consensus."" The firm says the potential upside ""is not appropriately calibrated for 2023+"" for the equipment rental company. ""As investors begin to calibrate 2023 estimates and potential upside, we would expect upward pressure on '23 estimates as infrastructure spending begins to materialize more meaningfully."" Morgan Stanley raises its price target to $395 from $297. United Rentals is stable at $357. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1056 ET - 2021 was really the year that crypto and digital assets became normalized, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at Wharton. Coinbase 's roughly $80B IPO this year was the ""first huge, major IPO of a crypto firm in the US,"" but the normalization was also supported by platforms like Square or Robinhood, he says. Ordinary retail investors are now starting to trade in something like bitcoin and ""starting to perceive (it) as not fundamentally different from investing in other kinds of asset classes."" About half of the crypto traders in the US got into the market in the last year, he says, and the numbers are significant, with 50 to 100M accounts in the US on crypto trading platforms and 200M to 300M worldwide.

1047 ET - President Biden has set a goal of a carbon-free electricity system by 2035, and to reach that goal BTU Analytics says natural gas power plants may still be needed, but might be outfitted with an emerging technology that captures carbon emissions to block them from causing global warming. The problem with that, however, is such a move may actually create even more gas demand. ""Ironically, full decarbonization of the gas fleet would require increased investment in natural gas infrastructure to fill the generation shortfall associated with deploying carbon capture and storage,"" BTU Analytics says. ""Not only would increased power generation require a corresponding increase in gas production, but it could also require additional pipeline buildout."" (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1037 ET - Despite Hormel reporting record sales and earnings this quarter, production labor shortages, supply-chain disruptions and higher feed costs held back some of its results, company executives say on the F4Q earnings call. Higher feed costs and labor shortages continue to hurt its Jennie-O brand turkey business, the company says. Feed costs also increased more than 60% from last year in F4Q. ""In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels,"" CFO James Sheehan says. ""Labor shortages may continue to be a significant factor affecting industry production."" (patrick.thomas@wsj.com; @PatThomas1318)

STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 9, 2021

The transaction was unanimously approved by CBAH's Board of Directors and was approved at the special meeting of CBAH's stockholders held on December 6, 2021 (the ""Special Meeting"").

Market Overview -- Commercial & Industrial Solar Market Poised for Significant Growth

Altus Power believes it is poised to grow with the accelerating demand for clean electricity at commercial and industrial (C&I) properties as well as community solar projects. Installed C&I solar generation capacity is projected to more than double by 2030, increasing from 17 gigawatts (GW) installed in 2020 to 48 GW installed at the end of the period. The battery storage market is expected to expand at a 46% annual rate to 2030.

Altus Power anticipates that the combination of technological innovation and strategic partnerships with CBRE and Blackstone will position Altus Power for success in the growing markets for locally sited, clean power generation and battery storage for businesses and homes.

We are thrilled to be adding CBRE as a strategic partner through this merger. Two of the largest players in global real estate are now our largest institutional investors. With CBRE and Blackstone as our strategic partners, we are well positioned to take advantage of the incredible growth opportunity ahead for clean electrification.""

Bill Concannon , Chief Executive Officer of CBAH and a member of the Altus Power Board of Directors, said, ""We are excited to bring financial and strategic resources to Altus Power that we expect will accelerate their growth plan and help to create long-term stockholder value. CBRE's real estate investor and occupier clients are increasingly focused on reducing their carbon footprints and meeting sustainability goals. We are working actively with Altus Power to bring its building-sited solar solutions and expertise to CBRE's clients. We believe our partnership will drive the growth of end-to-end renewable energy solutions in the marketplace.""

""While I'm not predicting any specific timing, we have seen time and time again 80% corrections in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies,"" he says, noting that there's no reason to believe volatility has gone away and a crypto shakeout is bound to occur at some point. (kavita.mokha@wsj.com)

1143 ET - The Fed could take markets by surprise at next week's meeting as it speeds up monetary tightening, deVere's Nigel Green says. ""The central bank will give several months' notice to the markets for a major policy shift. As such, if it is to maximize flexibility to raise rates, they will begin sooner rather than later, even as soon as next week."" Green expects turbulence to ensue, but he advises investors to ""embrace the volatility"" as a buying opportunity. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1140 ET - CVS Health says it aims to add 250 to 350 primary-care centers to its operations as part of a plan to expand its medical offerings. The company said last month that it needs doctors on its payroll to fulfill long-held ambitions of becoming a major provider of healthcare services. Acquiring clinics rather than recruiting physicians is part of CVS's strategy to grow the business amid a shortage of primary care doctors, says Alan Lotvin , executive vice president of CVS Health. He also says the company would consider acquiring a home-health company to expand its business of providing medical care at home. CVS gains 4.1% to $96.98. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1122 ET - Morgan Stanley expects infrastructure spending to boost nonresidential construction stocks, particularly United Rentals . ""Even after embedding more conservative outperformance assumptions, we expect URI to benefit from an underlying recovery in US Non-Resi spending - our FY22 revenue estimates now stand 1% ahead of consensus."" The firm says the potential upside ""is not appropriately calibrated for 2023+"" for the equipment rental company. ""As investors begin to calibrate 2023 estimates and potential upside, we would expect upward pressure on '23 estimates as infrastructure spending begins to materialize more meaningfully."" Morgan Stanley raises its price target to $395 from $297. United Rentals is stable at $357. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1056 ET - 2021 was really the year that crypto and digital assets became normalized, says Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at Wharton. Coinbase 's roughly $80B IPO this year was the ""first huge, major IPO of a crypto firm in the US,"" but the normalization was also supported by platforms like Square or Robinhood, he says. Ordinary retail investors are now starting to trade in something like bitcoin and ""starting to perceive (it) as not fundamentally different from investing in other kinds of asset classes."" About half of the crypto traders in the US got into the market in the last year, he says, and the numbers are significant, with 50 to 100M accounts in the US on crypto trading platforms and 200M to 300M worldwide.

1047 ET - President Biden has set a goal of a carbon-free electricity system by 2035, and to reach that goal BTU Analytics says natural gas power plants may still be needed, but might be outfitted with an emerging technology that captures carbon emissions to block them from causing global warming. The problem with that, however, is such a move may actually create even more gas demand. ""Ironically, full decarbonization of the gas fleet would require increased investment in natural gas infrastructure to fill the generation shortfall associated with deploying carbon capture and storage,"" BTU Analytics says. ""Not only would increased power generation require a corresponding increase in gas production, but it could also require additional pipeline buildout."" (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

1037 ET - Despite Hormel reporting record sales and earnings this quarter, production labor shortages, supply-chain disruptions and higher feed costs held back some of its results, company executives say on the F4Q earnings call. Higher feed costs and labor shortages continue to hurt its Jennie-O brand turkey business, the company says. Feed costs also increased more than 60% from last year in F4Q. ""In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels,"" CFO James Sheehan says. ""Labor shortages may continue to be a significant factor affecting industry production."" (patrick.thomas@wsj.com; @PatThomas1318)

1033 ET - CVS Health says the pandemic continues to be a ""net positive"" to its finances as demand for Covid tests and vaccines remains higher-than-expected. ""We keep thinking it's going to fall off and it doesn't,"" CVS finance chief Shawn Guertin says during the company's investor day. Covid eats into profits of the company's Aetna insurance arm, but is profitable for its retail business. As Covid cases surge and the US braces for potential impact from the new Omicron variant, demand for testing and vaccines could remain high, he says. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1031 ET - Hormel says it's closing a Jennie-O Turkey Store plant in Willmar, Minn., in F1H, saying the plant is an older, inefficient facility which produces numerous commodity items that the company wants to shift away from, company executives say. Employees will transition to its newer and larger facility also located in Willmar. ""We expect these actions to result in a more demand-oriented and optimized Turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers,"" CEO James Snee says on Hormel's earnings call. ""The transformation starts with accelerating our efforts to shift from commodity to branded value-added products."" Shares rise 4.1% to $44.50. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com; @PatThomas1318)

0907 ET - Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East says it's at the ""mercy"" of Boeing 's 787 production plans, with the freeze in Dreamliner deliveries clouding its cash flow. East says on an investor call that around 300M pounds in customer concessions for its Trent engines -- which power around a third of the jets -- have slipped while the planes await delivery. GE also sells engines for the 787. Rolls recently edged out GE and Raytheon's Pratt & Whitney unit to win a $2.6B deal to re-engine B-52 bombers. (doug.cameron@wsj.com)

0902 ET - Retail investors kept piling into the stock market as major indexes tumbled. Buying among retail investors continued at a strong pace during the recent stock-market volatility and inflows jumped on Nov. 26 while the S&P 500 lost 2.3%, according to JPMorgan Chase strategists. ""Their equity fund buying, which has been the major flow force reverberating into equity markets this year, continues to be strong,"" JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note on Thursday. The firm said that institutional investors like hedge-funds appeared to be the ones selling stocks during the turbulence. (gunjan.banerji@wsj.com; @gunjanjs)

AbbVie 's Allergan unit reached a $200 million deal Wednesday to settle allegations that it helped create and feed widespread opioid addiction in the state of New York.

Pharmaceuticals still face a social risk from the thousands of active lawsuits across the U.S. for their role in the opioid epidemic. The continuing New York lawsuit still includes subsidiaries of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries .

The directive was announced through internal communications channels to Amazon warehouse workers.

""The health and safety of our employees is of the utmost importance to us,"" the notice says. ""We hope this will only be required for the winter months and that further into 2022 we can return to our previous face covering policy, where permitted.""

It isn't the first time that Amazon has altered its stance on masks this year. The company in August began requiring all warehouse workers to wear them, regardless of vaccination status, in response to the rise of the Delta variant, which was spreading rapidly at the time. Last month, after Covid-19 infections slowed, Amazon said workers who showed proof of their vaccination status wouldn't have to wear masks unless local directives said otherwise. Now, the company has returned to requiring all warehouse workers to mask up.

Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Omicron had overtaken the Delta variant in the U.S. and accounted for an estimated 73% of infections for the week ended Dec. 18. CDC officials have encouraged people to wear masks in public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status.

The new variant's spread has been hurting businesses in a range of industries and has led companies to temporarily close offices or postpone plans for at-home workers to come back. Countries including Israel, the Netherlands and Germany have imposed travel restrictions, and many large-scale events such as concerts have been canceled or postponed. This week, the World Economic Forum said it would postpone next month's annual meeting in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos for the second successive year.

In recent months, some U.S. companies have moved to require all workers and guests at their facilities to get a Covid-19 vaccine, including Microsoft Corp . and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc .

Amazon hasn't mandated that its workers get vaccinated though it has offered incentives for them to do so, such as bonuses.

Early in the pandemic, lockdowns and work-from-home life caused a significant uptick in online shopping, prompting a surge in orders that was difficult for Amazon to keep up with as some warehouse workers stayed home. The company offered unpaid leave and a boost in pay for a time to encourage employees to work, but some criticized the company for being slow to enact policies that would limit the spread of Covid-19.

Amazon defended its response to the pandemic and said it complies with all laws and provides breaks and safety measures necessary to keep its warehouses operational. This year, the company raised wages throughout its facilities and introduced safety programs to educate workers about body mechanics.

The company employs about a million workers in the U.S. and has gone on several hiring sprees since the start of the pandemic, mostly adding hundreds of thousands of hourly employees to its warehousing operations.

The directive was announced through internal communications channels to Amazon warehouse workers.

""The health and safety of our employees is of the utmost importance to us,"" the notice says. ""We hope this will only be required for the winter months and that further into 2022 we can return to our previous face covering policy, where permitted.""

It isn't the first time that Amazon has altered its stance on masks this year. The company in August began requiring all warehouse workers to wear them, regardless of vaccination status, in response to the rise of the Delta variant, which was spreading rapidly at the time. Last month, after Covid-19 infections slowed, Amazon said workers who showed proof of their vaccination status wouldn't have to wear masks unless local directives said otherwise. Now, the company has returned to requiring all warehouse workers to mask up.

Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Omicron had overtaken the Delta variant in the U.S. and accounted for an estimated 73% of infections for the week ended Dec. 18. CDC officials have encouraged people to wear masks in public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status.

The new variant's spread has been hurting businesses in a range of industries and it has led companies to temporarily close their offices or postpone plans for at-home workers to come back. Countries including Israel, the Netherlands and Germany have imposed new travel restrictions, and many large-scale events such as concerts have been canceled or postponed. This week, the World Economic Forum said it would postpone next month's annual meeting in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos for the second successive year.

In recent months, some U.S. companies have moved to require all workers and guests at their facilities to get a Covid-19 vaccine, including tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.

Amazon hasn't mandated that its workers get vaccinated though it has offered incentives for them to do so, such as bonuses.

Early in the pandemic, lockdowns and work-from-home life caused a significant uptick in online shopping, prompting a surge in orders that was difficult for Amazon to keep up with as some warehouse workers stayed home. The tech giant offered unpaid leave and a boost in pay for a time to encourage employees to work, but some criticized the company for being slow to enact policies that would limit the spread of Covid-19.

Amazon has defended its response to the pandemic, and said it complies with all laws and provides breaks and safety measures that are necessary to keep its warehouses operational. This year, the company has raised wages throughout its facilities and introduced new safety programs aimed at educating workers about body mechanics.

Still, some employees have begun to ask for a return of pay increases such as a $2-an-hour bump that workers received for a time at the onset of the pandemic. The Amazon Labor Union, an independent group representing workers in the Staten Island borough of New York City, on Wednesday filed a second petition for a union election.

PARIS, France, December 23rd, 2021, 8:30 am CET - Pharnext SA (FR0011191287 - ALPHA) (the ""Company""), an advanced late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company pioneering new approaches to developing innovative drug combinations based on big genomics data and artificial intelligence using its PLEOTHERAPY(TM) platform, announces today the appointment of Dr. Elisabeth Svanberg MD, PhD to succeed Michel de Rosen as Chairman of the Board of Directors effective January 1st, 2022. Michel de Rosen has served as Chairman of the Board since June 2016 and will continue to serve as a Non-Executive Director.

Dr. Svanberg has extensive experience in the development of novel treatments across therapeutic areas. She received her MD and PhD from the University of Gothenburg and is a Board-certified general surgeon and Associate Professor of surgery. She is an experienced non-executive director serving on the Board of Galapagos NV, Egetis Pharmaceuticals, Amolyt and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (SOBI).

Dr. Svanberg joined Serono in 2000, initially in the field of metabolism, and subsequently held roles of increasing responsibility before joining Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) in 2007. At BMS, she served as Development Leader for dapagliflozin (Forxiga/Farxiga), a first in class medicine now registered and launched worldwide to treat type 2 diabetes, and subsequently was Vice President and Head of the Intercontinental Medical Department responsible for Canada, Latin America, Middle East & Africa, Asia Pacific and Australia / New Zealand. In 2014, Dr. Svanberg joined Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a Johnson & Johnson Company ) as Vice President, Head of the Established Products group, managing a portfolio of 90 products used by an estimated 150 million patients globally. Since 2016, Dr Svanberg has been an entrepreneur in the field of urogenital disorder.

Dr. Svanberg's experience will strongly benefit Pharnext , as the Company progresses its pivotal Phase III clinical study of PXT3003, the PREMIER trial, its lead drug candidate designed to treat Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). CMT1A is a rare progressive, inherited neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves and currently has no existing approved therapies.

On her appointment as Chairman of the Board, Dr. Elisabeth Svanberg commented: ""I am excited to take on the Chairman role at this important time for Pharnext and work alongside my fellow Board members and our management team to support the Company as it advances the pivotal study of PXT3003 in CMT1A. I want to thank Michel and the Board of Pharnext for the confidence placed in me. Michel has led the Company to this pivotal moment, and I look forward to continuing to build from Michel's foundations. I'm delighted that Michel is staying on to continue his support of the transition.""

Michel de Rosen , outgoing Chairman of the Board at Pharnext , commented: ""After chairing the Board of Pharnext for more than five years, I believe the time has come for a new person to take that role. Elisabeth Svanberg is remarkably qualified for that mission. Her expertise in drug development, her experience in senior management and in biotech boards, her international background, her leadership skills, her rigor and integrity will be precious assets for the Board of Pharnext as the company moves ahead. I believe in the future of Pharnext and especially in its CMT1A drug candidate.""

On Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker said its letter was written only to comply with U.S. law and didn't represent Intel's stance on Xinjiang.

""We deeply apologize for the confusion caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,"" Intel said in its statement, which was posted on its social-media platforms in China. Intel didn't specify which law it was seeking to comply with.

The letter was published around the time that the U.S. Senate passed legislation last week banning imports from the Xinjiang region over concerns about the use of forced labor. The bill, titled the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, is now headed to the desk of President Biden, who is expected to sign it into law. The U.S. and other Western governments have sought to punish Beijing over its policies toward Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang, which U.S. government officials, lawmakers and human-rights activists have said amounts to genocide.

It also comes just weeks ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Intel is one of 14 global companies that have contracts with the International Olympic Committee to sponsor multiple Olympics. Human-rights groups have put pressure on Olympic sponsors to speak up on human rights or pull out ahead of the Beijing Games, which are slated to begin Feb. 4.

Researchers say China's government has detained as many as one million members of mostly Muslim minorities in a network of internment camps as part of a campaign of forcible assimilation that also includes mass surveillance, forced labor and stringent birth controls.

China's government has rejected those allegations, portraying its campaign in Xinjiang as an innovative effort to fight religious extremism and terrorism.

It is hard to tell how organic social-media firestorms are, as Chinese authorities and technology companies heavily censor and moderate discussions within the country.

Researchers of social-media trends and disinformation analyzing Chinese activity have found Communist Party-run news outlets often amplify nationalist Chinese social-media campaigns. After Sweden's H&M and American rival Nike Inc. were hit earlier in the year over their expressions of concern about forced labor in Xinjiang, researchers in Taiwan found state-media outlets and Communist Party-affiliated social-media accounts fanning the flames of anger online.

Multinational companies have been caught in the middle as Western governments have pressured companies to disentangle their supply chains from Xinjiang. Sportswear company Adidas AG and fast-fashion giant H&M Hennes and Mauritz AB are among those that have run afoul of social-media users in China, one of the fastest-growing large consumer markets in the world. Those that have apologized to Chinese consumers, meantime, risk a backlash from lawmakers and consumers back home.

China was Intel's largest market by revenue from 2018-2020. The chip maker earned $20.9 billion in sales from China and Hong Kong in 2020, about one-quarter of its annual revenue, according to company filings.

In an unsigned editorial published after Intel's letter began to circulate, China's state-run Global Times tabloid criticized Intel for offending the Chinese people. The paper said Intel's actions were aimed at improving its own standing before the U.S. government and called on Beijing to make it ""increasingly expensive for companies to offend China.""

The editorial also urged China to speed up the localization of its chip supplies. ""An important reason why Intel dares to offend China over the Xinjiang-related affairs is that it holds the monopoly of the global chip market,"" the editorial read.

Karry Wang, a singer with wildly popular Chinese boy band TFBoys, said Wednesday that he would step down as brand ambassador for Intel over the matter.

""National interests trumps everything,"" the celebrity's management office said in comments posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform.

By late Thursday, Intel's apology was among Weibo's top trending topics, with more than 340 million views. The issue attracted comments from users who criticized the American chip maker for what they described as Intel's lack of sincerity.

Others lamented China's reliance on Intel and the lack of domestic alternatives. ""It's not Intel that can't leave us, it's China that can't break off from Intel,"" one user wrote, in a comment that attracted thousands of likes and hundreds of replies. ""We don't have any local products to substitute for Intel's.""

A spokesman for Intel declined to comment beyond its Thursday apology.

In 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel was among a handful of U.S. companies selling components to China's surveillance industry. Intel, through its venture-capital arm, had also provided seed money, chips and technical solutions to NetPosa Technologies Ltd., a Chinese company providing surveillance technologies to police bureaus in Xinjiang. Intel said at the time that its products are used by customers world-wide for a variety of applications.

NetPosa was placed on a U.S. Commerce Department export blacklist last year, and was added to a Treasury Department investment blacklist last week.

Earlier this year, H&M was wiped off China's internet after the fast-fashion giant said it would stop sourcing from Xinjiang. A Chinese consumer boycott followed, costing H&M some $74 million in lost sales in China for the three months ended May 31.

Other consumer brands, including Adidas and Nike, also suffered a decline in China sales after joining a consortium of Western brands that raised concerns over alleged forced-labor practices in Xinjiang.

On Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker said its letter was written only to comply with U.S. law and didn’t represent Intel’s stance on Xinjiang.

“We deeply apologize for the confusion caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,” Intel said in its statement, which was posted on its social-media platforms in China. Intel didn’t specify which law it was seeking to comply with.

The letter was published around the time that the U.S. Senate passed legislation last week banning imports from Xinjiang region over concerns about the use of forced labor. The bill, titled the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, is now headed to the desk of President Biden, who is expected to sign it into law. The U.S. and other Western governments have sought to punish Beijing over its policies toward Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in Xinjiang, which U.S. government officials, lawmakers and human-rights activists have said amounts to genocide. Researchers say China’s government has detained as many as one million members of mostly Muslim minorities in a network of internment camps as part of a campaign of forcible assimilation that also includes mass surveillance, forced labor and stringent birth controls.

China’s government has rejected those allegations, portraying its campaign in Xinjiang as an innovative effort to fight religious extremism and terrorism.

Multinational companies have been caught in the middle as Western governments have pressured companies to disentangle their supply chains from Xinjiang. Sportswear company Adidas AG and fast-fashion giant H&M Hennes and Mauritz AB are among those that have run afoul of social-media users in China, one of the fastest-growing large consumer markets in the world. Those that have apologized to Chinese consumers, meantime, risk a backlash from lawmakers and consumers back home.

China was Intel’s largest market by revenue from 2018-2020. The chip maker earned $20.9 billion in sales from China and Hong Kong in 2020, about one-quarter of its annual revenue, according to company filings.

In an unsigned editorial published after Intel’s letter began to circulate, China’s state-run Global Times tabloid criticized Intel for offending the Chinese people. The paper said Intel’s actions were aimed at improving its own standing before the U.S. government and called on Beijing to make it “increasingly expensive for companies to offend China.”

The editorial also urged China to speed up the localization of its chip supplies. “An important reason why Intel dares to offend China over the Xinjiang-related affairs is that it holds the monopoly of the global chip market,” the editorial read.

Karry Wang, a singer with wildly popular Chinese boy band TFBoys, said Wednesday that he would step down as brand ambassador for Intel over the matter.

“National interests trumps everything,” the celebrity’s management office said in comments posted on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform.

By late Thursday, Intel’s apology was among Weibo’s top trending topics, with more than 340 million views. The issue attracted comments from users who criticized the American chip maker for what they described as Intel’s lack of sincerity.

Others lamented China’s reliance on Intel and the lack of domestic alternatives. “It’s not Intel that can’t leave us, it’s China that can’t break off from Intel,” one user wrote, in a comment that attracted thousands of likes and hundreds of replies. “We don’t have any local products to substitute for Intel’s.”

A spokesman for Intel declined to comment beyond its Thursday apology.

In 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel was among a handful of U.S. companies selling components to China’s surveillance industry. Intel, through its venture-capital arm, had also provided seed money, chips and technical solutions to NetPosa Technologies Ltd., a Chinese firm providing surveillance technologies to police bureaus in Xinjiang. Intel said at the time that its products are used by customers world-wide for a variety of applications.

Netposa was placed on a U.S. Commerce Department export blacklist last year, and was added to a Treasury Department investment blacklist last week.

Earlier this year, Sweden’s H&M was wiped off China’s internet after the fast-fashion giant said it would stop sourcing from Xinjiang. A Chinese consumer boycott followed, costing H&M some $74 million in lost sales in China for the three months ended May 31.

Other consumer brands, including Adidas and American rival Nike Inc., also suffered a decline in China sales after joining a consortium of Western brands that raised concerns over alleged forced-labor practices in Xinjiang.

The Big Pivot: Merck Falters on Covid-19 Vaccine, Then Makes One for Rival J&J


By Jared S. Hopkins | Photographs by Hannah Yoon for The Wall Street Journal 

Weeks after Merck & Co . scrapped development of its Covid-19 vaccines in January, one of its senior manufacturing officials began phoning his deputies, telling them their work on a pandemic shot wasn't actually over.

The twist: Merck would manufacture the vaccine from an arch rival.

""We're doing it,"" John McGrath told his workers at Merck. ""And we're doing it with J&J.""

The Johnson & Johnson -Merck partnership, which the companies announced in March, is now bearing fruit to expand the world's vaccine supply. After a frantic ramp-up that involved scouting for raw materials, buying equipment and upgrading plants all at the same time, the first Merck-made shots shipped Friday.

Merck is churning out more than 500,000 doses daily for use outside the U.S., including countries desperate for shots.

J&J's unusual collaboration with a rival, and Merck's speedy manufacturing run-up, reflect one of the biggest challenges of the pandemic: making enough Covid-19 vaccines to meet the high demand.

Even in the U.S., early supplies were limited as drugmakers ramped up production lines. To this day, many countries are struggling with short supply.

At a sprawling plant in West Point, Pa., Merck is helping J&J with the final stages of its vaccine production, known as fill-finish, which involves thawing frozen doses made by J&J, adding a stabilizer to maintain their potency during storage, then putting them into vials for shipment.

Merck, one of the world's biggest drugmakers by sales, said it retrofitted its manufacturing facilities in about three months, shaving almost a year off the time it normally takes to ready a plant.

""We broke all sorts of records on construction, on tech transfers, on just getting product ready,"" Mr. McGrath said. The federal government, which gave at least $105 million to Merck to retrofit plants, also contributed by moving needed supplies quickly through customs.

Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine hasn't been embraced by people and health authorities as much as initially expected, partly because of concerns about a rare blood-clotting condition. Manufacturing issues have also played a role in limiting its use.

Yet if enough doses are made, the vaccine still can play an important role in the pandemic because many poor countries lack access to other shots and J&J's vaccine is easier to handle and store, public-health advocates and Wall Street analysts say.

The J&J vaccine doesn't require a special freezer to keep it cold, unlike messenger-RNA vaccines, and the primary series is one dose, not two.

""Our vaccine is uniquely positioned to be used in the world,"" said Remo Colarusso, J&J's global manufacturing chief. ""The world is not completely vaccinated by a long shot.""

J&J and Merck, their headquarters separated by about 18 miles in New Jersey, are normally competitors in areas such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Last December, at the urging of the federal government, the rivals began discussing whether Merck coud help make J&J's Covid-19 vaccine.

J&J Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels was initially reluctant to work with another company, people familiar with the matter said. He was concerned it would stretch his staff too thin because of existing manufacturing partnerships, but agreed after an appeal by National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, the people said.

During a Jan. 4 call between U.S. officials, Dr. Stoffels and then-Merck Chief Executive Ken Frazier , the companies agreed to assess whether Merck's plants could adapt to make J&J's shot, the people said.

At the time, Merck was searching for a role in the pandemic response. It had begun clinical trials of two Covid-19 vaccines, but they ultimately failed, with Merck halting the programs in late January. Its Covid-19 antiviral, molnupiravir, was still being tested.

Merck fit as a partner because of its decades of manufacturing vaccines, Mr. Colarusso said.

Another key: Merck's production line in West Point was sitting idle after the Covid-19 vaccines flopped. Merck also wasn't using a freshly built 4,000-square-foot cold-storage room with 18 specialized freezers that the company had built for its Covid-19 shots. Each freezer could hold 5.5 million J&J doses.

The West Point plants sit on a leafy campus 30 miles outside Philadelphia. It is Merck's largest workplace -- in terms of space and number of workers -- and has its own ZIP Code. Despite the available rooms and equipment, Merck needed to upgrade its facilities, because J&J's vaccine uses vials smaller than Merck's failed Covid-19 shots, as well as a newer vaccine technology.

""Our issue then became what equipment do we need, where can we get it, how quickly can we get it, is it available, and if not, then what's our alternatives?"" said Mr. McGrath, an industry veteran who joined Merck in 2019.

Merck found that it needed to quickly secure equipment and raw materials even as other drugmakers required them for their own products. Merck needed about 200 chemicals and devices such as filters. Such items typically take between two and three months to get, but Merck needed them in weeks.

Merck leaned on its relationships with suppliers, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc ., which provided specialized plastic bags used to purify and filter the vaccine. Merck also paused production of some non-Covid-19 products, which might have yielded sales to competitors but freed up equipment and materials, Mr. McGrath said.

In April, workers discovered that a screw used to keep vials steady as they moved down the production line wasn't working. The vials wobbled, and some fell down, jamming the production line. Merck worked with a vendor in Japan to redesign the screws.

In May, Merck workers discovered another issue with the vials while doing test-runs of the production line using water. They became top-heavy with water when filled. To resolve the issue, a Merck machinist designed a plate that held the containers securely, said Kim Dezura, the West Point plant manager.

""Those are the types of little things that you encounter,"" she said. ""We want to solve those early so that they don't create bigger issues later.""

Once filled, vials must be transferred from trays to cardboard boxes for shipment without sustaining damage and before they get too warm. J&J didn't specify how to do this, so its rival honed its own system.

Initially, Merck tried moving vials one by one, but that took too long and was too physically hard for workers. Using 3-D printers, Merck built workstations for workers to release vials from a tray, sort them into rows, scoop out the containers and transfer them 39 at a time.

In August, Merck began manufacturing commercial doses, Ms. Dezura said. It took the companies until recently to receive regulatory approvals clearing shipments. J&J then got the doses at its distribution center in the Netherlands, and released the doses Friday for global distribution.

Merck plans to make doses with J&J at its plant in North Carolina, a more difficult process that is taking longer to finish.

Ms. Everson started at Instacart in early September.

Ms. Everson's planned departure was earlier reported by CNBC, and comes after chief revenue officer Seth Dallaire left in October.

The company said it wouldn't replace Ms. Everson at this time, and declined to comment further.

Ms. Simo wrote Friday in a memo to staff that the company's current leadership team can take on more roles, and that there was a ""mismatch"" between Instacart's priorities and what Ms. Everson was looking for. Ms. Simo wrote that Ms. Everson's departure gives the company an opportunity to make organizational changes that will put it in a better position.

Chief Operating Officer Asha Sharma's role will expand, according to the memo, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Sharma, who also joined from Facebook, will now oversee product, marketing, operations and other teams. Chris Rogers, vice president of global retail, will lead partnerships with grocery chains and report to Ms. Simo.

Ryan Mayward, who leads Instacart's advertising team, will now report to Chief Financial Officer Nick Giovanni. Instacacart's legal, people and technology teams will report to Ms. Simo, according to the memo.

Ms. Everson wrote in a Facebook post Friday that she is taking time off while she thinks about her next steps, as she turns 50 on Friday. Ms. Everson said that she and Ms. Simo agreed that her departure was the best decision for Instacart and for her personally.

""I cannot wait to watch and cheer on the journey and success of the team, "" Ms. Everson wrote.

San Francisco-based Instacart's business boomed last year as people ordered more groceries online and avoided shopping in person, because of the pandemic.

Grocery delivery remains expensive to operate, however, and the company has been looking for ways to offset costs by expanding its advertising business.

The company, which has said it plans to go public and currently has a valuation of $39 billion, also is broadening its grocery operations. Instacart has been expanding into 30-minute delivery with retailers such as Kroger Co. and Publix Super Markets Inc. The company has recently acquired a maker of automated shopping carts and a catering software company, looking to build out a range of services that Instacart has said will help supermarkets better compete against e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc.

Instacart in July said that it would start building fulfillment centers for supermarkets over the next 12 months, in partnership with technology company Get Fabric Inc. The warehouses will be in or near grocery stores, with capacity for 10,000 to 50,000 items, according to Instacart.

In such fulfillment centers, the company will use robots to pull items from warehouses and have Instacart's workers pack and deliver orders. Instacart currently deploys shoppers who grab products from grocery stores and drop them off at people's homes.

Ms. Everson spent more than 10 years at Facebook, overseeing relationships with advertisers. She started as president at Instacart with the role of leading the company's retail, advertising and business-development teams, among others. She was one of several high-profile hires from Facebook, along with Ms. Simo and Ms. Sharma.

Ms. Simo previously led the social-media giant's mobile and products teams, and had served on Instacart's board before taking over as CEO. Ms. Sharma led Facebook's communications features such as Messenger.

It is No. 261 in customer satisfaction among the 846 companies examined for this year's ranking.

Amazon.com Inc. ranks second overall this year, followed in order by Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., with Intel Corp. rounding out the all-tech top five.

""They were well managed and they made the most of a pretty chaotic environment,"" says Zachary First, Drucker's executive director, of the top-ranked companies. ""Last year was a good time for companies that know how to innovate and know the value of innovation.""

The analysis captures data through the end of June, reflecting the impact of the pandemic as well as the first few months of the economic recovery.

Microsoft's overall score has increased more than any other company's since Drucker researchers began ranking the best-managed companies in 2017, The increase in its innovation score over that period also is the biggest of any company.

In November, Mr. Nadella reaped some of the benefit of the Microsoft's success, selling about half of his shares in the company. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Redmond, Wash.-based software company reported Mr. Nadella sold 838,584 shares over two days, out of holdings of close to 1.7 million shares. The transaction yielded more than $285 million for Mr. Nadella. The company said he sold the stock for personal financial planning and diversification reasons.

Not all technology companies thrived in 2021. Some early-pandemic darlings cooled off in this year's rankings. Zoom Video Communications Inc., ranked in the top 200 a year ago, fell out of the Top 250 after declining customer and employee satisfaction scores. After nearly two years of working virtually during the pandemic for many people, there are clear signs of burnout in an era of nonstop video calls, though companies have said they expect flexible work arrangements to endure. Zoom didn't respond to requests for comment for this article.

Google parent Alphabet Inc. fell eight spots from a year ago to No. 13 this year, in part because of a 17-point decline in its employee engagement and development score, as well as smaller declines in innovation and social responsibility. A group of Google employees formed a union during the pandemic, the Alphabet Workers Union, to organize workers and give them the ability to speak out about the company. This October, In an interview at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said employee activism pushes companies to be more accountable. Google didn't comment for this article.

Warning signs

While every company has flaws, the Management Top 250 ranking aims to point out firms that are particularly good at balancing a wide range of what are often competing management priorities. For instance, the 34 metrics used to determine the rankings include employee pay compared with industry averages, patent applications and three-year average total shareholder return.

The researchers also use a ""red flag"" system to highlight companies with particularly weak scores in one or more dimension of Drucker's scorecard. The red flags serve as a warning that a company -- even one that scores highly in every other aspect of the ranking -- needs to address an area of weakness before it has a broader effect on its business.

This year, 56 companies in the Management Top 250 in a wide range of industries were flagged, including Allstate Corp. and Walmart Inc. for low scores in employee engagement and development, Philip Morris International Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. for customer satisfaction, Nasdaq Inc. for innovation, Tesla Inc. for social responsibility and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. for financial strength.

Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms Inc., earned a red flag this year for its weak customer-satisfaction score. Meta fell 19 spots in the overall ranking this year, to No. 31 from No. 12 last year, with its disproportionately low customer-satisfaction score coming amid continuing criticism of Facebook's alleged harm to some users and the company's handling of misinformation, among other issues. The Drucker researchers say Meta's overall statistical profile bears a resemblance to those of big tobacco firms: high marks for financial strength but low scores for customer satisfaction.

A spokesman for Meta declined to comment.

Stalwarts and stumbles

Another prominent name, Procter & Gamble Co., the maker of Tide, Bounty and many other consumer products, remained in the top 10 thanks to high scores across the ranking's five dimensions of performance. The company has benefited from consumer shifts spurred by the pandemic, but it also began making changes to its complex management structure that had sometimes put brand managers and country managers at odds.

P&G is one of eight companies this year with particularly high scores across all five dimensions of the ranking. The others are Intel, Nvidia Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., HP Inc., Merck & Co., Visa Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp.

AT&T Inc. fared worse, dropping 106 spots, to No. 166 this year from No. 60 last year -- despite a higher customer-satisfaction score this year -- due to declines in innovation, social responsibility, employee engagement and development, and especially financial performance. Earlier this year, AT&T decided to unwind its big bet on entertainment by agreeing to combine WarnerMedia with Discovery Inc. in a new publicly traded company, completing AT&T's retreat from the media business.

""The data doesn't capture employee or customer response to the public announcement of the deal, but it does capture employee and customer response to the realities of a company struggling with what to own and what to divest,"" says Drucker's Mr. First.

An AT&T spokeswoman pointed to company CEO John Stankey's comments at the time of the merger announcement that it will help AT&T be one of the best-capitalized broadband companies, focused on investing in 5G.

It was also a down year for ExxonMobil Corp., which fell off the Top 250 list entirely this year -- from No. 177 last year -- after its financial-strength rating declined. In 2021, an activist investor successfully campaigned to win seats on the board of the oil giant. The remade board of directors is debating whether to more forward with several major oil and gas projects as the company reconsiders its investment strategy in a fast-changing energy landscape.

An Exxon spokesman says the rankings capture one of the most challenging years in company history, and that in 2021 it made progress improving earnings and operating performance in a recovering market. In October, Exxon reported quarterly earnings of $6.8 billion, its best quarterly performance since 2017. The industry is reaping the rewards of resurgent commodity prices as the economy emerges from pandemic-driven stagnation.

Exxon has fallen the farthest since the first Drucker ranking. Since 2017 the company has declined in all dimensions of the ranking except its social-responsibility score, which is based on various metrics that reflect environmental, social and corporate-governance issues, the researchers say.

Drucker's social-responsibility metric relies on various ESG rating services that reward companies for having policies in place for emission reduction or for not using forced labor in their supply chain, among other things. But it doesn't measure if a company follows through on its pledges. For example, companies may earn higher marks for statements made in response to the murder of George Floyd last year, but whether or not they followed through on any diversity and inclusion efforts would be better represented in the ranking's employee-satisfaction score, the researchers say.

""This is an area in which you have to work with the data you have,"" says Mr. First. ""Companies can do fairly well on these systems simply by disclosing and reporting certain things.""

The Best-Managed Companies of 2021 -- and How They Made It to the Top -- Journal Report


By Patrick Thomas 

Technology giants reign as America's best-run companies.

The companies earning the highest marks in this year's Management Top 250 ranking have capitalized on what is now a nearly two-year stretch of pandemic-driven economic upheaval that has changed the way people work and shop.

At the very top, Microsoft Corp. held on to its No. 1 spot in the annual ranking, which uses the principles of the late management guru Peter Drucker to identify the most effectively managed companies. Microsoft ranks no lower than sixth in four of the five main components of the overall ranking compiled by researchers at Claremont Graduate University's Drucker Institute: employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength.

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
     -- We have historically added a notch to our ratings on U.S. 
Bancorp --after and in addition to our assessment of its stand-alone credit 
profile (SACP)--to reflect its outperformance of similarly rated peers. 
     -- Due to a change in our criteria for rating financial institutions, we 
are now incorporating our view of U.S. Bancorp 's peer outperformance directly 
in the SACP and therefore revised up the SACP by one notch. 
     -- Because we rate hybrid securities relative to the SACP, we raised our 
issue ratings on U.S. Bancorp 's subordinated debt and preferred stock to 'A' 
and 'BBB+' and on certain subsidiaries' subordinated debt and preferred stock 
to 'A+' and 'A-'. 
     -- The change in the SACP has no impact on our issuer credit ratings on 
U.S. Bancorp , which we affirmed at 'A+/A-1' with a negative outlook. 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 10, 2021--S&P Global Ratings said today it 
raised its issue ratings on the subordinated debt and preferred stock of U.S. 
Bancorp 's nonoperating holding company (NOHC) and a related trust to 'A' and 
'BBB+', respectively, from 'A-' and 'BBB'. We also raised our ratings on the 
subordinated debt and preferred stock issued by certain subsidiaries to 'A+' 
and 'A-', respectively, from 'A' and 'BBB+'. We removed those ratings from 
under criteria observation, where we placed them following the publication of 
our updated criteria for rating financial institutions on Dec. 9, 2021. We 
affirmed all our other ratings on U.S. Bancorp  and its subsidiaries, including 
our 'A+/A-1' long- and short-term issuer credit ratings. The outlook on the 
long-term rating remains negative. 
 
We revised up our SACP on U.S. Bancorp  and therefore raised our ratings on its 
subordinated debt and preferred stock due to a change in our criteria--even 
though we have not changed our view of the company's overall creditworthiness 
or changed the issuer credit ratings. 
 
We now reflect U.S. Bancorp 's outperformance of similarly rated peers in its 
SACP--specifically, in our comparable ratings analysis--to arrive at the 
company ratings. Under our prior criteria, we had reflected its peer 
outperformance in a ratings adjustment similar to the comparable ratings 
analysis, but one made after and in addition to the SACP. 
 
Our revision of U.S. Bancorp 's SACP to 'aa-' from 'a+' has led us to upgrade 
the company's subordinated debt and preferred stock at both the NOHC and 
subsidiaries because we rate hybrid securities relative to the SACP. We do so 
because of their higher default risk relative to more senior debt and our 
belief that an issuer could default on them without triggering a general 
default or failure of the company. (We rate senior debt relative to the 
company's group credit profile.) 
 
Despite the SACP revision, we affirmed all our other issuer and issue ratings 
on the company and its subsidiaries. Our ratings on U.S. Bancorp  continue to 
reflect its excellent banking franchise with strong market shares and superior 
business stability, as well as above-peer-average profitability and good risk 
management. We balance those strengths with the heightened integration risk of 
a pending lower-quality acquisition that increases the bank's concentration in 
California. 
 
The negative outlook on U.S. Bancorp  and its operating subsidiaries reflects 
our view of the elevated risks associated with the acquisition of MUFG Union 
Bank  over the next two years. Specifically, we consider in the outlook 
heightened operational and integration risks associated with the acquisition, 
as well as added loan concentration and possible customer attrition. 
 
We could lower our ratings on U.S. Bancorp  if we believe its post-acquisition 
risk profile will not remain consistent with its strong historical performance 
prior to the acquisition. We could also lower the ratings if the company no 
longer consistently outperforms its peers. The following could demonstrate 
declining performance: 
     -- Profitability that is no longer above and loan losses that are no 
longer below peer levels; or 
     -- A deterioration in earnings quality or an increase in risk appetite, 
including elevated exposure to credit, operational, market, or liquidity risk. 
In addition, we could lower our ratings on U.S. Bancorp  if the company's 
capital declines so that its regulatory capital ratios are well below peers', 
or if nonperforming assets and loan losses exceed our expectations. 
 
We could revise the outlook on U.S. Bancorp  to stable if it successfully 
integrates Union Bank and if we expect its risk profile after the acquisition 
to remain strong. We will also take into account the company's risk and 
performance compared with similarly rated and lower-rated peers.

The move could value Mobileye at north of $50 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, and Intel would retain a majority stake. Intel acquired the Israeli company in 2017 for around $15 billion. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said the offering would give Mobileye an ability to attract more business. Intel shares rose 3.1% Tuesday.

AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP

AAL -0.2%

The chief executive of American Airlines is handing in his wings. The company revealed Tuesday that CEO Doug Parker will step down next year, passing the controls over to Robert Isom. Mr. Parker was a champion of airline consolidation, engineering mergers that transformed the industry and built American into an industry giant. Mr. Isom has served as the company's president since 2016. Later in the week, the company said it would trim international flights next summer because of Boeing Co.'s delays in delivering new 787 Dreamliners. American shares fell 0.2% Tuesday.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN GROUP

RCL +8.2%

Stocks rose this week on hopes the new Omicron strain will have a less-pronounced impact on travel and consumer confidence than first feared. Scientists are still assessing the strain's severity and how well existing vaccines work against it, but Wall Street has increased conviction another major economic shock isn't coming. Cruise lines were among the biggest winners. Royal Caribbean jumped 8.2% Monday, and Carnival Corp. rose 8.1%.

PFIZER INC.

PFE -0.6%

Pfizer and its vaccine partner BioNTech SE said a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests, boosting antibodies and providing significantly more protection than two doses do. Still, two doses may prove effective in preventing severe illness, they said Wednesday. The results were issued in a press release by the companies, and weren't peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal. On Thursday, U.S. health regulators cleared the Covid-19 booster from the two companies for use in 16- and 17-year-olds, widening eligibility. Pfizer shares fell 0.6% Wednesday.

STARBUCKS CORP.

SBUX -0.8%

Labor unrest is brewing in Buffalo, N.Y. Starbucks baristas there voted to form the first labor union at one of the coffee giant's U.S. cafes in its 50-year history. The workers said they would push the company to bargain over pay and other matters. In separate elections at two other area stores, one voted against a union and results in the other weren't conclusive Thursday. The National Labor Relations Board said it will review challenges from both sides. In September, popular support for unions hit a high last shown in 1965, according to Gallup. Starbucks shares fell 0.8% Thursday.

TYSON FOODS INC.

TSN +0.3%

Tyson is letting the robots into the henhouse. The Arkansas-based meat giant said Thursday it plans to spend about $1.3 billion to automate parts of its production lines over the next three years, as meatpackers struggle with a nationwide labor shortage that left many processing plants understaffed. Tyson, a U.S. chicken producer responsible for producing about one-fifth of the country's poultry, said it expects to save about $450 million by the end of its 2024 fiscal year from reduced labor costs and increased production from automation. Tyson shares rose 0.3% Thursday.

GENERAL MOTORS CO.

GM +6%

GM is giving a jolt to Michigan's economy. The car maker plans to invest more than $3 billion in two electric-vehicle projects that will be located in its home state, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, a potential win for Michigan after a recent influx of auto projects into Southern states. One project would convert its Orion Assembly plant in suburban Detroit to serve as its hub for production of electric pickup trucks, potentially creating more than 1,500 jobs at a factory that today is lightly used, the Journal reported. GM shares rose 6% Friday.

The bank expects quarterly rate rises after that. JPMorgan also expects the Fed to follow through on its chatter and accelerate the pace of its bond buying taper process. The Fed will take ""the monthly reduction in the purchase pace from $15 billion per month to $30 billion per month [which] keeps the math simple, and results in a mid-March end to asset purchases,"" it says, adding that ""any tapering announcement will be conveyed in the post-meeting statement, and we expect it will reiterate the option to adjust the pace in response to changing developments.""

The FTSE 100 company could offer more than 70% total return to shareholders in the medium-term, Elliot says. The hedge fund further says it wants the house builder to bring in at least two new independent directors and for it to start a committee to advise on operations. n Taylor Wimpey closed down 0.9% at 167.5 pence.

1525 GMT - Improved prices for farm commodities like corn and soybeans have been fueling a surge in farmers paying off debts they may have amassed during the extended downturn of previous years, the Kansas City Fed says. The Fed says the volume of delinquent farm loans has dropped 30% to 40% from this time last year. ""The quick turnaround in repayment issues led to the lowest rate of delinquency on farm loans for the third quarter since 2015,"" the Fed says. However, the general slowdown in taking out loans may soon end, the central bank says. ""Input costs have risen considerably in recent months, which is likely to increase credit needs and weigh on profit margins going forward."" (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

1502 GMT - Canada's household debt-to-disposable income ratio rose in 3Q to 177.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis, bringing it closer to the record levels recorded before the pandemic and presenting a potential hurdle for the Bank of Canada 's plans to raise interest rates. Household disposable income rose during the quarter, Statistics Canada says, but debt climbed by even more. ""This makes households more sensitive to interest rate increases and will be a key factor in how fast and how far the Bank of Canada can tighten policy over the coming year,"" BMO Capital Markets economist Priscilla Thiagamoorthy says.

1015 GMT - Worldline should be able to meet its target of organic revenue growth above 6% this year, UBS says. At virtual meetings with the French fintech company's CEO Gilles Grapinet and CFO Eric Heurtaux this week, Grapinet was confident about achieving the company's 2021 guidance, the Swiss bank says. ""We considered the guidance conservative at the time of the Capital Markets Day in October, when it was introduced, and therefore we see less risk to current trading given 4Q is already well advanced, but we also do not see any chance of a 'strong' beat,"" UBS says.

The Biden administration has accused the Chinese government of engaging in genocide against religious minorities in the region.

Last week, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, following its near-unanimous passage in Congress. The law bans all imports to the U.S. from the region unless companies can certify that such products are free from forced labor.

China has rejected allegations of genocide and forced labor, describing its policies in the region as aimed at preventing terrorism and protecting national security.

Last week, U.S. semiconductor giant Intel Corp. issued an apology to Chinese consumers, partners and the public following an outcry on Chinese social media against the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, which had published on its website a letter to suppliers asking them to avoid sourcing from Xinjiang. The original letter said that the restrictions were required in response to U.S. law.

Other Western businesses, including fast-fashion retailer H&M Hennes and Mauritz AB and sportswear maker Nike Inc., have also recently been targets of Chinese consumer fury. H&M's online presence was erased from the Chinese internet this spring after the Swedish apparel firm said it would stop sourcing from Xinjiang.

Walmart was dragged into the controversy on Friday after users wrote on domestic social-media platforms -- including Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service, and Zhihu, a Quora-like question-and-answer forum -- that they were unable to find products typically sourced from Xinjiang on online stores operated by Walmart and Sam's Club China. Sam's Club is Walmart's members-only wholesale retail chain.

Some users posted that online customer-service agents had told them such products, including red dates and apples, were out of stock. A U.S.-based Walmart spokesperson declined to comment.

The Wall Street Journal found no Xinjiang product listings on Walmart and Sam's Club's China e-commerce stores. However, a visit to a Walmart store in Beijing's central business district on Saturday found red dates sourced from Xinjiang on its shelves.

One Weibo user accused Walmart of ""eating China's rice, yet slapping our face,"" while others said they were canceling their Sam's Club memberships. Others said they would boycott Walmart stores.

Chinese social-media campaigns are often not as organic as their overseas peers, as authorities and technology firms curate and censor domestic online content.

Walmart's internet backlash followed a similar playbook to past nationalistic boycott campaigns on Chinese social media. The Communist Youth League's social-media account urged consumers to boycott Sam's Club stores, while the state-run Global Times newspaper reported that Sam's Club had stopped sales of Xinjiang products, citing unnamed sources.

The Global Times reported that cantaloupes -- commonly known in China as ""Hami melons,"" after a city in eastern Xinjiang famous for producing the fruit -- were now being sourced from the southern Chinese island of Hainan. It quoted a salesperson in a Beijing store saying that Xinjiang raisins hadn't been on store shelves since May, though the employee didn't know the reason.

Melons, red dates and grapes were among the largest fruit crops in Xinjiang in 2019, according to the most recent figures on the website of the region's statistics bureau. Xinjiang is also China's largest cotton-producing region, accounting for almost 90% of the country's cotton production, according to figures from China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

China is a key pillar of Walmart's international expansion strategy, as the U.S. retailing giant seeks to streamline operations to focus on e-commerce and the fastest-growing global markets.

China is home to 434 Walmart and Sam's Club stores, covering more than 69 million square feet, as of the end of January, making the country Walmart's second-largest international market by retail square footage, according to the company's most recent annual report -- second only to Mexico, where the big box retailer runs almost more than 2,600 stores.

In the most recent quarter, China proved to be a bright spot for Walmart's international sales, Walmart President Doug McMillon told investors in an earnings call last month.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said in September that 30% of retail and consumer companies polled in its most recent business survey cited public backlash and consumer boycotts as a top concern, the highest among the major industries covered by the business lobby. More than one-tenth of the companies said they had reduced planned investments in China because of concerns about consumer boycotts.

Since Walmart's sourcing of Xinjiang products began attracting attention online, competitors including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Hema supermarket chain swooped in to take a swipe at the U.S. retailer. Carrefour SA, whose more than 200 stores in China are owned by Suning.com, a domestic online retailer, shared a post on Friday carrying the hashtag ""Carrefour Xinjiang Fine Goods Festival,"" with pictures of Xinjiang-sourced products on its store shelves.

The social-media post on Carrefour's official Weibo account included nine photos of apples, walnuts, cotton socks and hand towels for sale on its store shelves, with bright yellow labels reading: ""I come from Xinjiang.""

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 28, 2021--

The transaction is anticipated to be modestly accretive to American Tower's AFFO per Share initially, and increasingly accretive over time.

""Cowen prefers to own stocks tailored toward the high end consumers, and stocks that provide deep value to the lower-end consumers,"" wrote lead analyst Oliver Chen. Those include LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (ticker: MC:France), RH, (RH), the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, Brilliant Earth Group (BRLT), Costco Wholesale (COST), and Walmart (WMT).

Costco, Brilliant Earth, RH, and LVMH can hold steady against inflation thanks to their pricing power and market share, Chen wrote. RH, for example, has about a 4.5% market share of the furniture industry, and Brilliant Earth has about $61 billion of the $300 billion global fine jewelry market, the analysts say.

The firm's top retail pick for 2022 is department store Macy's (M), which is up about 134% this year. The company has faced pressure to separate its digital operation from its bricks and mortar business, but Cowen says Macy's is accelerating its digital business, which could reach $10 billion in sales by fiscal year 2023. That would account for about 40% of overall revenue, according to Cowen estimates.

Other retail-giant picks include Target (TGT) and Walmart, which have successfully merged their physical store operations with digital strategies, Chen wrote. Target, Walmart and Costco are also multicategory stock picks that offer services that include next-day and two-day delivery, curbside pickup, and partnerships with Instacart.

Investors shouldn't overlook the beauty industry as ""consumers' awareness and preference for health and wellness remain elevated,"" the analysts wrote. E.l.f. Beauty (ELF), Olaplex Holdings (OLPX), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), Beauty Health (SKIN), the parent of Hydrafacial, and Ulta Beauty (ULTA), each offer ""innovation, pricing and generation Z, "" factors. Of the picks, Olaplex is projected to see the most sales growth -- 26.6% -- in a global cosmetics industry set to hit $415.29 billion from 2021 to 2028.

""It's a concern for our auto industry because it's a subsidy that goes against the trade agreement,"" he says. Lopez Obrador avoids threats of retaliatory tariffs. ""I don't like to talk about tariff action on our part because there are legal mechanisms we can resort to in the event this measure goes ahead. We can reach an agreement so this doesn't hurt Mexico."" Canada last week said it would impose retaliatory tariffs on US exports and launch a dispute settlement process under USMCA if the tax credit -- part of the ""Build Back Better"" bill before the US Senate -- goes ahead.

1359 ET - Bank of America analysts warn in research of even higher inflation. In a note, the firm said that the personal consumption expenditures index, the central bank's preferred inflation measure, will jump to a 5.6% year-over-year gain for November, up from the already very high 5% seen in October. That forecast compares with the Fed's 2% inflation target, and points to why the central bank is facing such pressure to move toward a withdrawal of stimulus, so as to help tame high price pressures.

1316 ET - Olo says Lyft drivers will begin shuttling food from its network of restaurants. The restaurant order-management platform says it will handle the dispatching of delivery orders from restaurants in its network, including to Lyft drivers. Rival Uber works directly with restaurants in offering delivery with its couriers, a service that has grown rapidly during the pandemic. Olo falls 4.1% and Lyft gains 2.1%.

1311 ET - Boeing 's November deliveries include a 737 MAX to Singapore Airlines , one of only six aircraft handed directly to Asian carriers this year, two of them freighters. Airbus has delivered more than 90 passenger jets to what remains, outside China at least, the slowest recovering region over the same period. Half as many again have been delivered by leasing companies to Asian carriers. Boeing shares off session lows as 737 MAX deliveries of 28 last month matched analysts' expectations, though shares are still down 0.7%. (doug.cameron@wsj.com)

1255 ET - Omicron is spreading at a faster rate than previous variants, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news briefing, raising concerns that people may be misjudging the threat of the variant. ""Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril,"" Tedros says. ""Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems."" While some 77 countries have reported cases of Omicron, the variant is probably already present, even if undetected, in most countries, he says. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)

1225 ET - Beyond Meat may debut on more McDonald's menus across the US as soon as 1Q, analysts say. The plant-based meat maker's products can currently be found at eight McDonald's locations as part of a test program. ""The McPlant product with Beyond Meat is performing well at the handful of restaurants offering it, warranting a more expansive market test in early 2022,"" BTIG says. BTIG expects the fast-food chain will likely roll out the McPlant menu in several markets for a limited time. Piper Sandler says the launch could be wider, coming to almost all of McDonald's roughly 14,000 US locations. Piper Sandler raised its 2022 US foodservice revenues target by $35M and now expects Beyond's share price to hit $64 from its previous target of $61. Beyond Meat rises 6.1% to $67.29.

1207 ET - About 74% of respondents expect to increase logistics outsourcing budgets in the next two years, according to Gartner . The survey of 298 supply-chain professionals in the US, Europe and APAC was conducted from March through May. Asked about their top three priorities, most cited improving or updating technology, followed by cost reduction/optimization and increasing customer satisfaction. ""In the face of ongoing disruptions, growing carrier influence and customer selection, shippers and 3PLs must work together to mutually protect their vested interests,"" Gartner 's David Gonzalez says.

1159 ET - With Cabaletta Bio shares plumbing new depths, analysts at Evercore ISI say lackluster signals from the two lowest-dose cohorts in a Phase 1 study of lead candidate DSG3-CAART are disappointing, but not an abject failure. Evercore says expectations about the study had gotten too high, with some investors confusing the company's enthusiasm in a previous update as a nod toward early efficacy rather than a nod toward early safety. The analysts say data from higher-dose cohorts next year should more clearly tell whether Cabaletta's platform is viable in its current iteration or if it needs more work. Evercore keeps its outperform rating on the stock but cuts its price target to $20 from $28. Cabaletta down 70% to $3.73. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

1156 ET - Natural catastrophes hit an estimated $105B globally in 2021, the fourth highest since 1970, says Swiss Re Institute in preliminary estimates. These included a deep winter freeze, floods, severe thunderstorms, heatwaves and a major hurricane. ""Hurricane Ida was the main loss-making event, but once again more than half of the global losses came from secondary perils,"" such as winter storms. The insured losses from natural disasters again exceeded the previous 10-year average. ""Natural catastrophe losses are likely to continue to grow more than global GDP given increases in wealth, urbanisation and climate change,"" the institute says. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

1146 ET - Rising inflation is going to increase the base price of anything transportation related, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says. Though he also says demand is still strong for Uber, ""I do think it's important for us to invest in lower cost product, which is why we have brought back shared rides."" Khosrowshahi, speaking at a UBS event, adds that while higher prices generally are structurally better for Uber's profit margins, ""we're actively making sure that prices are no higher than they should be."" Uber is also working on a strategic portfolio of lower-priced products, which he says should give the company an advantage over its competitors. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1139 ET - Uber has done a lot of acquisitions over the past few years and isn't likely to do many more in the year ahead, the company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi , says at a UBS event. ""We are always looking in the market for opportunities, but right now the hurdle is unusually high,"" he says. ""When I look at 2022, all things being equal, I think there'll be less activity going forward."" Uber's purchases of companies such as Careem, Postmates and Cornershop means the company has a bigger geographical footprint that it can build on organically, he says.

1159 ET - With Cabaletta Bio shares plumbing new depths, analysts at Evercore ISI say lackluster signals from the two lowest-dose cohorts in a Phase 1 study of lead candidate DSG3-CAART are disappointing, but not an abject failure. Evercore says expectations about the study had gotten too high, with some investors confusing the company's enthusiasm in a previous update as a nod toward early efficacy rather than a nod toward early safety. The analysts say data from higher-dose cohorts next year should more clearly tell whether Cabaletta's platform is viable in its current iteration or if it needs more work. Evercore keeps its outperform rating on the stock but cuts its price target to $20 from $28. Cabaletta down 70% to $3.73. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

1156 ET - Natural catastrophes hit an estimated $105B globally in 2021, the fourth highest since 1970, says Swiss Re Institute in preliminary estimates. These included a deep winter freeze, floods, severe thunderstorms, heatwaves and a major hurricane. ""Hurricane Ida was the main loss-making event, but once again more than half of the global losses came from secondary perils,"" such as winter storms. The insured losses from natural disasters again exceeded the previous 10-year average. ""Natural catastrophe losses are likely to continue to grow more than global GDP given increases in wealth, urbanisation and climate change,"" the institute says. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

1146 ET - Rising inflation is going to increase the base price of anything transportation related, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says. Though he also says demand is still strong for Uber, ""I do think it's important for us to invest in lower cost product, which is why we have brought back shared rides."" Khosrowshahi, speaking at a UBS event, adds that while higher prices generally are structurally better for Uber's profit margins, ""we're actively making sure that prices are no higher than they should be."" Uber is also working on a strategic portfolio of lower-priced products, which he says should give the company an advantage over its competitors. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1139 ET - Uber has done a lot of acquisitions over the past few years and isn't likely to do many more in the year ahead, the company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi , says at a UBS event.

""When I look at 2022, all things being equal, I think there'll be less activity going forward."" Uber's purchases of companies such as Careem, Postmates and Cornershop means the company has a bigger geographical footprint that it can build on organically, he says.

1130 ET - Citi analysts say the FDA 's clinical holds on Merck's studies of islatravir confirms their concerns about the HIV drug candidate that triggered last month's downgrade. Citi already removed islatravir from its model when it cut the stock to neutral, saying it expects Merck to abandon the drug. However, Citi closes its negative catalyst watch on the stock, as it believes the current share price fully discounts the anticipated termination of islatravir, minimizing downward risk. Citi says it expects islatravir's likely demise to further accelerate Merck's business development efforts to address the Keytruda loss of exclusivity in 2028. Merck up 1% to $73.39.

1109 ET - North American freight spending hit a record level in November as shipping rates surged on tight capacity and strong transportation demand. The spending component of the Cass Freight Index rose to 4.275 in November, up 44% year-over-year and an 8% increase from October. Shipping volumes rose 1.4% from October despite persistent backups at US ports, showing progress as transport operators work through distribution bottlenecks, Cass information Systems says. One example: ""recent easing in semiconductor shortages, as shown by improving automotive rail carloadings."" Cass's Truckload Linehaul Index fell sequentially in November as price increases slowed but is projected to keep trending higher. (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

1104 ET - Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says the company's ride-hailing business last week had its strongest performance since the start of the pandemic and is near pre-pandemic levels, even with the spread of the omicron virus variant that he says has had local impacts. ""The mobility business is getting better even in what is a variable environment right now,"" he says at a UBS event.

1041 ET - The Conference Board of Canada said its business-confidence index fell sharply in November to mid-2020 levels, as inflation and supply-chain constraints have weighed on short-term prospects. The nonpartisan Ottawa think tank said November's results contained ""many concerning signals."" Half of respondents indicated they expected annual inflation to rise 5%-plus over the next six months; three-quarters of executives surveyed indicated either they expected supply-chain disruptions to either deteriorate further or remain the same; and 54% suggested labor shortages were hampering investment plans. The survey was conducted between Nov. 10 and Nov. 24, and with the results the confidence index fell 19 points to 85.6 -- down from a 104.6 reading in August, or the highest level in 15 years.

0942 ET - Ubisoft Entertainment says its chief studios operating officer is leaving the videogame company to pursue other activities. Virginie Haas had served in the position for 16 months after three years as an independent board director. Her departure follows that of several other Ubisoft executives since mid-2020, when the company said it was investigating allegations of misconduct. Ubisoft in May announced it had taken steps to make its workplace more inclusive but a group of current and former employees says the company hasn't done enough. The group, called ABetterUbisoft, announced on Saturday that 13,000 people have signed an online petition demanding more change. Ubisoft shares off roughly 2%.

MGM Resorts, which bought the casino-hotel in 2000, had announced its plan to sell in November as it focuses on growth areas, such as sports betting and pursuing a new casino in Japan.

“This transaction is a significant milestone for MGM Resorts, and for Las Vegas,” said MGM Resorts Chief Executive Bill Hornbuckle. “As part of the team that opened The Mirage in 1989, I know firsthand how special it is, and what a great opportunity it presents to the Hard Rock team.”

The Mirage real estate is owned by MGM Growth Properties LLC, a publicly traded real-estate investment trust that MGM Resorts spun off in 2016. MGM Growth Properties, which owns the real estate of several Strip resorts, is in the middle of a deal to be acquired by Vici Properties Inc. for about $17.2 billion, including $5.7 billion in debt. That deal was expected to close in the first half of 2022.

Hard Rock said that it plans to enter into a long-term lease agreement for the Mirage real estate with Vici Properties.

MGM Resorts said it expects net cash proceeds from the sale, after taxes and fees, to be about $815 million. It will keep the Mirage brand and license it to Hard Rock royalty-free for up to three years while Hard Rock completes its rebranding of the property, the company said.

Even as it is selling off the Mirage business, MGM Resorts is still investing some of its energies in the Strip. The company agreed earlier this year to buy the operations of the Cosmopolitan, for about $1.6 billion from Blackstone Inc. MGM Resorts’ other Strip casinos include the Bellagio, MGM Grand, Luxor and New York-New York.

Rules issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  in November require employers with 100 or more workers to ensure employees are vaccinated or take weekly Covid-19 tests by Jan. 4.

Whether those rules, which were targeted by lawsuits across the country, will take effect is uncertain. Last week, a U.S. court blocked the plan to mandate vaccines for federal contractors. General Electric Co . and others have since suspended vaccine requirements for employees. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati is considering whether to reinstate the administration's rules for employers.

Kroger 's monthly surcharge applies to salaried employees, and doesn't apply to hourly employees enrolled in the company's health plan, or those represented by labor unions. About 66% of its workforce is unionized.

Kroger  joins an increasing number of employers adding surcharges for unvaccinated employees. Delta Air Lines Inc . in August added a $200 monthly surcharge to its healthcare plan to alleviate the financial burden stemming from the pandemic. The carrier said it saw early signs of success, with the number of employees receiving their first Covid-19 shot tripling from the typical daily rate.

The board of Nevada Public Employees' Benefits Program voted this month to add surcharges for state employees, retirees and their dependents who are unvaccinated. Employees and retirees under the state's health plan are subject to a $55 monthly surcharge, under policies set to go into effect in July, and dependents are subject to a $175 monthly surcharge. More than 4,000 out of 23,000 state employees remain unvaccinated, said Laura Rich, executive officer of the state's public employees benefits program.

The program's board decided that the financial costs of tests and hospitalizations should be shifted to people who refuse to be vaccinated, Ms. Rich said, adding that the board views the surcharge to be the only method available to encourage vaccinations.

Supermarkets rely on hundreds of thousands of front-line workers, but most haven't enforced a vaccine or test mandate or changed their policies. Industry executives have said they are hesitant about making big changes, fearing workers may quit if required to get vaccinated or tested weekly. They have also said costs continue to rise for labor and transportation.

A Kroger spokeswoman said the company is modifying policies to encourage safe behaviors as it prepares to navigate the next phase of the pandemic, and that the changes are designed to create a healthier workplace and workforce. She said the company considered feedback from employees and customers to guide its policies, and that Kroger  will continue to encourage sick employees to stay home and seek the support of a physician if they contract the coronavirus. Unvaccinated employees can take paid time off or apply for unpaid leave, she said. Kroger  has been motivating staffers to get vaccinated with a $100 payment.

Kroger 's Covid-19 policy changes don't apply to employees with approved medical or religious accommodations, according to the memo. The company said in the memo that it continues to prepare and develop responses to OSHA's Covid-19 vaccine requirement.

Taking away paid Covid-19 sick leave is risky because many hourly wage workers likely don't have the savings to stay at home, said Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institution 's Metropolitan Policy Program, which describes itself as nonpartisan. She said infected employees who needed income could go to work and endanger other employees and customers.

""We are almost two years into the pandemic, but we are not out of the woods,"" Ms. Kinder said, given the spread of the Omicron variant.

The retail industry has faced monthslong labor shortages. Some store workers have quit because they switched industries or were worried about spreading or contracting Covid-19 in public settings, industry executives have said. Others have stayed out of the job market because of child-care duties or savings they accumulated during the pandemic.

Many grocery chains have been offering payments to encourage vaccinations. Companies have also kept plastic barriers at cash registers, are encouraging social distancing, and are sanitizing stores more frequently than they did before the pandemic. Most have ended hazard pay for workers in stores and warehouses. Mask policies for employees remain across many supermarket chains, though some stores have struggled to manage customers who show up without face coverings or refuse to wear them properly.

Adding a surcharge can be an effective way to encourage vaccinations because people are risk-averse when facing losses, said Helen Leis, a partner at consulting firm Oliver Wyman Inc . who advises companies on pandemic responses. At the same time, she said, the penalty has to be large enough to get employees' attention.

""Folks who are choosing not to be vaccinated are very dedicated to their decisions,"" Ms. Leis said.

Piper Sandler raised its 2022 US foodservice revenues target by $35M and now expects Beyond's share price to hit $64 from its previous target of $61. Beyond Meat rises 6.1% to $67.29.

1207 ET - About 74% of respondents expect to increase logistics outsourcing budgets in the next two years, according to Gartner . The survey of 298 supply-chain professionals in the US, Europe and APAC was conducted from March through May. Asked about their top three priorities, most cited improving or updating technology, followed by cost reduction/optimization and increasing customer satisfaction. ""In the face of ongoing disruptions, growing carrier influence and customer selection, shippers and 3PLs must work together to mutually protect their vested interests,"" Gartner 's David Gonzalez says.

1159 ET - With Cabaletta Bio shares plumbing new depths, analysts at Evercore ISI say lackluster signals from the two lowest-dose cohorts in a Phase 1 study of lead candidate DSG3-CAART are disappointing, but not an abject failure. Evercore says expectations about the study had gotten too high, with some investors confusing the company's enthusiasm in a previous update as a nod toward early efficacy rather than a nod toward early safety. The analysts say data from higher-dose cohorts next year should more clearly tell whether Cabaletta's platform is viable in its current iteration or if it needs more work. Evercore keeps its outperform rating on the stock but cuts its price target to $20 from $28. Cabaletta down 70% to $3.73. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

1156 ET - Natural catastrophes hit an estimated $105B globally in 2021, the fourth highest since 1970, says Swiss Re Institute in preliminary estimates. These included a deep winter freeze, floods, severe thunderstorms, heatwaves and a major hurricane. ""Hurricane Ida was the main loss-making event, but once again more than half of the global losses came from secondary perils,"" such as winter storms. The insured losses from natural disasters again exceeded the previous 10-year average. ""Natural catastrophe losses are likely to continue to grow more than global GDP given increases in wealth, urbanisation and climate change,"" the institute says. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

1146 ET - Rising inflation is going to increase the base price of anything transportation related, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says. Though he also says demand is still strong for Uber, ""I do think it's important for us to invest in lower cost product, which is why we have brought back shared rides."" Khosrowshahi, speaking at a UBS event, adds that while higher prices generally are structurally better for Uber's profit margins, ""we're actively making sure that prices are no higher than they should be."" Uber is also working on a strategic portfolio of lower-priced products, which he says should give the company an advantage over its competitors. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1139 ET - Uber has done a lot of acquisitions over the past few years and isn't likely to do many more in the year ahead, the company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi , says at a UBS event. ""We are always looking in the market for opportunities, but right now the hurdle is unusually high,"" he says. ""When I look at 2022, all things being equal, I think there'll be less activity going forward."" Uber's purchases of companies such as Careem, Postmates and Cornershop means the company has a bigger geographical footprint that it can build on organically, he says.

1130 ET - Citi analysts say the FDA 's clinical holds on Merck's studies of islatravir confirms their concerns about the HIV drug candidate that triggered last month's downgrade. Citi already removed islatravir from its model when it cut the stock to neutral, saying it expects Merck to abandon the drug. However, Citi closes its negative catalyst watch on the stock, as it believes the current share price fully discounts the anticipated termination of islatravir, minimizing downward risk. Citi says it expects islatravir's likely demise to further accelerate Merck's business development efforts to address the Keytruda loss of exclusivity in 2028. Merck up 1% to $73.39.

BOZEMAN, Mont., Dec. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FICO) announced today that it priced $550 million in aggregate principal amount of additional notes (the ""Additional Notes"") of the same class as its outstanding $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2028 that were issued on December 6, 2019 (the ""Existing Notes"") in a private offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The Additional Notes will be issued pursuant to the indenture governing the Existing Notes. Further, the Additional Notes will have the same CUSIP number and ISIN as (except that Additional Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S will trade separately under a different CUSIP number and ISIN until at least 40 days after the issue date of the Additional Notes and thereafter, subject to the terms of the indenture governing the notes and the applicable procedures of the depositary), and to be fungible for trading purposes with the Existing Notes. The Additional Notes were priced to investors at 99.750% of their principal amount and are senior unsecured obligations of FICO.

FICO intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Additional Notes to repay certain indebtedness outstanding under its existing revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses.

FICO expects to close on the sale of the Additional Notes on December 17, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.

A Pfizer spokeswoman, who said the company wasn't involved in the case, referred questions to Bayer AG, which acquired Monsanto in 2018. Pharmacia spun off from Monsanto in 2002 and merged with Pfizer in 2003.

A Bayer spokesperson couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The sites were used by local industries to dispose of hazardous and other wastes over much of the past century, the Justice Department said Tuesday. The remedial actions will help mitigate exposure to harmful contaminants, such as lead, cadmium, benzene and chlorobenzene that can cause cancer, the agency said.

Solutia and Pharmacia have previously paid for the removal of hazardous waste in the area and installed a wall to prevent contaminated groundwater from leaching into the Mississippi River, the Justice Department said.

This is one in a number of cases and settlements the Justice Department and EPA are engaged in that call for polluters to pay for the investigation and cleanup of superfund sites, the agency said.

In October, Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, Bayer CropScience Inc., TFCF America Inc., and Stauffer Management Co. LLC agreed to pay more than $77 million for the cleanup and investigation of two superfund sites in Los Angeles County and over $8 million in reimbursement costs to the EPA and a California agency.

DEERFIELD, Ill., FORT WORTH, Texas, and SAN RAMON, Calif., Dec. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Progress Rail , a Caterpillar Inc. Company (NYSE: CAT), BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), and Chevron U.S.A. Inc . (Chevron ), a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), today announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to advance the demonstration of a locomotive powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

The goal of the demonstration is to confirm the feasibility and performance of hydrogen fuel for use as a viable alternative to traditional fuels for line-haul rail. Hydrogen has the potential to play a significant role as a lower-carbon alternative to diesel fuel for transportation, with hydrogen fuel cells becoming a means to reduce emissions.

Under the MOU, the parties are working toward reaching definitive agreements on a demonstration with three primary objectives. First, Progress Rail plans to design and build a prototype hydrogen fuel cell locomotive for line-haul and/or other types of rail service. Second, Chevron expects to develop the fueling concept and infrastructure to support this use of the locomotive. Lastly, the prototype hydrogen fuel cell locomotive is expected to be demonstrated on BNSF's lines for a mutually agreed upon period of time.

""Caterpillar has made great strides in moving our advanced power technology forward. Our Progress Rail team will leverage that knowledge and experience toward a hydrogen fuel cell locomotive,"" said Joe Creed , Caterpillar group president of Energy and Transportation. ""Working with Chevron and BNSF will allow us to advance hydrogen technology across the industry.""

""BNSF is pleased to collaborate with Chevron and Progress Rail in piloting locomotives powered by hydrogen fuel cells,"" commented John Lovenburg, vice president of Environmental for BNSF. ""This technology could one day be a lower-carbon solution for line-haul service, as it has the potential to reduce carbon emissions and remain cost competitive.""

""Chevron is dedicated to scaling up its hydrogen business to help meet the needs of customers who want to reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions of their operations,"" said Jeff Gustavson , president of Chevron New Energies. ""Our work with Progress Rail and BNSF is an important step toward advancing new use cases for hydrogen in heavy duty transport, as we seek to create a commercially viable hydrogen economy.""

As previously announced, Caterpillar Inc . is collaborating with Chevron for the demonstration of hydrogen projects in transportation and stationary power applications.

The proposed demonstration project is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements with customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. If established, additional details about the hydrogen locomotive demonstration, including where the initial pilot will take place and its timing, will be released at a later date.

(NASDAQ: IMTX, ""Immatics""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company active in the discovery and development of T cell-redirecting cancer immunotherapies, and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), today announced that they have entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement (the ""agreement"") for Immatics' TCR Bispecific candidate, IMA401.

Under the terms of the agreement, Immatics will receive an upfront payment of $150 million as well as up to $770 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalty payments on net sales of IMA401. Immatics retains the options to co-fund U.S. development in exchange for enhanced U.S. royalty payments and/or to co-promote IMA401 in the US.

IMA401 is the most advanced product candidate in Immatics' TCR Bispecifics pipeline, called TCER(R) (T Cell Engaging Receptors), in which one binding region targets MAGEA4/8, a highly prevalent antigen in multiple solid tumors, and the other region engages and activates T cells. In preclinical https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=13G_z026nxaY0pij9vxPQswWox498iZO28Ql_VQsCY8T0GhEXjFekAab8I_GPUgotNigQgPGNq6TtvUuZF7yZGZBmn909m-Q9i8f7R-isMIZMKmiV36MMGqMYweWnr7WmOvyWxXFPXBe39Qbk4X57jBJUGM5KGaRtTuWXdoUZ2hA6D3BLuWQBFTkrf-9hb6b268M3kRb_CYsbCyP_Hl729l908ePiEwv-kIv4UKLuAsXwZOV5NOf_4ftceWUqIVM  proof-of-concept studies, IMA401 has shown anti-tumor activity with complete remissions in various in vivo tumor models including patient-derived xenograft models. The agreement outlines a development plan under which both companies will collaborate to advance the program through clinical development.

In November 2021, Immatics filed a Clinical Trial Application (CTA)(1) with Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI), the German federal regulatory authority, for the development of IMA401. The clinical trial, which is planned to commence in the first half of 2022, will enroll patients across various solid tumor types.

""At Immatics, we are committed to our goal of delivering meaningful clinical benefits to cancer patients, and based on the promising preclinical data, we see remarkable potential for our TCER(R) platform"" said Carsten Reinhardt, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer at Immatics. ""We are delighted to extend our existing collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to the IMA401 program and view this as an important validation of the therapeutic potential of our TCER(R) approach. Bristol Myers Squibb 's global clinical development and commercialization capabilities in oncology make them the ideal partner for the further development of IMA401.""

""We are pleased to expand our collaboration with Immatics to now include IMA401,"" said Teri Foy, Senior Vice President, Research and Early Development, Immuno-Oncology and Cell Therapy at Bristol Myers Squibb . ""TCER(R)s are an important, emerging modality for solid tumors with the potential for cell therapy-like efficacy in an off-the-shelf platform offering potentially broader patient access. We look forward to advancing IMA401 into the clinic to further assess its potential as an innovative medicine to help patients prevail over serious diseases.""

About IMA401

IMA401 is Immatics' half-life extended TCER(R) molecule that targets an HLA-A*02-presented (human leukocyte antigen) peptide derived from two different cancer-associated proteins, melanoma-associated antigen 4 and/or 8 (""MAGEA4/8""). MAGEA4/8 is highly prevalent in several solid tumor types including squamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, bladder, uterine, esophageal and ovarian carcinomas, as well as melanoma, sarcoma subtypes and other solid cancer types.

About TCER(R)

Immatics' TCER(R) molecules are antibody-like ""off-the-shelf"" biologics that leverage the body's immune system by redirecting and activating T cells towards cancer cells expressing a specific tumor target. To do so, the proprietary biologics are engineered to have two binding regions. The first region contains an affinity- and stability-improved TCR that binds specifically to the cancer target on the cell surface presented by an HLA molecule. The second region is derived from an antibody domain that recruits endogenous T cells to the tumor to become activated. The design of the TCER(R) molecules enables the activation of any T cell in the body to attack the tumor, regardless of the T cells' intrinsic specificity. In addition, the TCER(R) molecule has a Fc-part conferring stability, half-life extension and enhanced manufacturability.

MGM said back in November that it was putting the Mirage in Las Vegas up for sale. The company at the time didn't disclose any potential buyers.

The hotel opened in 1989.

The company has been moving into other areas such as sports betting as part of its ""asset-light"" strategy.

The shortages were compounded by burnout among many medical workers and the lure of high pay rates offered to nurses who travel to hot spots on short-term contracts.

More recently, thousands of nurses have left the industry or lost their jobs rather than get vaccinated. As of September, 30% of workers at more than 2,000 hospitals across the country surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were unvaccinated.

""It's been a mass exodus, and a lot of people in the healthcare industry are willing to go and shop around,"" said Wade Symons, an employee-benefits lawyer and head of consulting firm Mercer's U.S. regulatory practice. ""If you get certain healthcare facilities that don't require it, those could be a magnet for those people who don't want the vaccine. They'll probably have an easier time attracting labor.""

A federal judge in Louisiana ruled in November that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services didn't have the authority to mandate vaccines for healthcare workers, blocking a Biden administration rule that affected some 10 million workers. The mandate had required all workers at facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid to get second shots by Jan. 4. The American Hospital Association estimates that 42% of U.S. hospitals, some 2,640 facilities, have Covid-19 vaccine mandates in place.

""I don't think the mandates were helpful and I think the court in Louisiana did everyone a service,"" said Alan Levine, chief executive officer of Ballad Health, which runs 21 hospitals in Tennessee and Virginia.

Mr. Levine said his company has about 14,000 employees, some 2,000 of whom are unvaccinated or didn't request an exemption to the requirement. ""That many people having to be terminated would have been devastating to our system,"" Mr. Levine said.

HCA, among the country's largest healthcare providers by number of hospitals, said in November that all employees needed to get vaccinated by the Jan. 4 federal deadline. HCA said it suspended its vaccine requirement after courts halted the federal mandate.

""We continue to strongly encourage our colleagues to be vaccinated as a critical step to protect individuals from the virus,"" HCA spokesman Harlow Sumerford said. He said a majority of HCA's roughly 275,000 employees are fully vaccinated.

AdventHealth and Tenet also said they wouldn't require employees to be vaccinated after the court decision. Workers in states that mandate vaccination must comply with local laws, HCA and Tenet said.

The Cleveland Clinic, which has 19 hospitals in Ohio and Florida and about 65,000 U.S. employees, and Utah hospital giant Intermountain Healthcare also said they would suspend vaccine requirements following the courts' actions. The Cleveland Clinic said it would add safety measures, such as periodic testing for unvaccinated employees who care for patients. Intermountain said 98% of its workforce had complied with the federal mandate.

Research into vaccine mandates has shown them to be largely effective. Psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania published research in the journal Nature in October showing that vaccine mandates were more likely to prompt workers to get a shot than to discourage them from doing so.

A study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Covid-19 cases and deaths were higher among residents of nursing homes with the lowest rates of staff vaccination. Researchers found that during the summer of 2021, 4,775 Covid-19 cases and 703 nursing-home-resident deaths from the illness could have been prevented if nursing-home staff had higher vaccination rates.

Not all hospital systems have scratched the mandate. Kaiser Permanente, which runs 39 hospitals and hundreds of medical offices in California and other states and employs nearly 210,000 people, said it gave employees until Dec. 1 to get vaccinated. So far, 98% of staff are vaccinated, but on Wednesday the hospital system terminated 352 employees, and another 1,500 face termination in early January unless they become fully vaccinated or receive an exemption, Kaiser said.

Northwell Health, New York state's largest healthcare provider with 77,000 employees, said its mandate remains in place. In October, Northwell told The Wall Street Journal that 1,400 employees had been terminated for refusing to get vaccinated.

""We will not hire anyone who has not been vaccinated,"" a spokesman said.

0942 ET - Ubisoft Entertainment says its chief studios operating officer is leaving the videogame company to pursue other activities. Virginie Haas had served in the position for 16 months after three years as an independent board director. Her departure follows that of several other Ubisoft executives since mid-2020, when the company said it was investigating allegations of misconduct. Ubisoft in May announced it had taken steps to make its workplace more inclusive but a group of current and former employees says the company hasn't done enough. The group, called ABetterUbisoft, announced on Saturday that 13,000 people have signed an online petition demanding more change. Ubisoft shares off roughly 2%.

0823 ET - Jefferies remains positive on the integrated oil-and-gas sector in 2022, and says that its favorite companies within the industry are those with the best combination of free cash flow generation and natural-gas exposure. This is because the gas market is expected to remain incredibly tight, with prices above $10 per million British thermal units through 2025. Therefore, Jefferies recommends companies with higher gas price leverage to either European spot markets--Equinor and OMV--or the liquefied natural gas market--Shell and TotalEnergies . Overall, Jefferies expects the sector to generate 65% of its current market capitalization as free cash flow over the next five years, leaving material upside to shareholder remuneration.

0805 ET - Two months after its planned $1.2B union with vertical farming company AeroFarms fell apart, blank-check company Spring Valley Acquisition says it will combine with nuclear small modular reactor technology company NuScale Power in a deal worth $1.9B. Spring Valley, which raised more than $200M late last year amid a record boom in special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in October said it had mutually agreed to call off its merger with AeroFarms parent Dream Holdings after Dream determined that the deal wasn't in the best interests of its holders. Spring Valley, which faced a dissolution deadline in May 2022, says it will now merge with NuScale, whose majority owner Fluor Corp . will hold 60% of the combined company. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

0710 ET - Nor-Shipping, a big ocean transport and logistics conference in Oslo scheduled for January, has been postponed on concerns over the rapidly expanding Omicron Covid variant. The meeting which happens every other year attracts over 50,000 industry executives, who make deals from multi-billion ship orders to agreeing charter rates with big cargo owners.

0540 ET - Rentokil Initial shares fall 3% after the pest-control and washroom-service group said it plans to buy Terminix Global Holdings Inc . in a deal valuing the U.S. company at $6.7 billion. Rentokil is paying a fairly big premium, though a significant part of that is accounted for by its own shares and the deal could boost the U.K. company's earnings, AJ Bell says. ""The use of the word 'transformational' to describe the deal by Rentokil boss Andy Ransom may also be giving some investors pause for thought,"" AJ Bell 's Investment Director Russ Mould says.

0448 ET - Ocado Group shares top the FTSE 100 risers, up 8% after the online grocer and retail-technology supplier reported strong underlying fourth-quarter demand. Ocado also said the U.S. International Trade Commission had ruled in its favor in a patent case. ""The announcement has provided some relief to Ocado 's share price, which is down more than 30% year-to-date. That's partly down to concerns that the firm is continually loss-making, despite posting large gains in revenue and customer numbers in recent years,"" eToro analyst Adam Vettese says. ""That's to be expected of a company in the growth phase, but seeing as it's 20 years-old, you would expect that to have changed by now."" (philip.waller@wsj.com)

Immatics and Bristol Myers Squibb Enter Into Global Exclusive License for Immatics' TCR Bispecific Program IMA401 


   -- Bristol Myers Squibb  secures global exclusive license to Immatics' TCR 
      bispecific program IMA401; companies will collaborate on development with 
      Immatics retaining a co-promotion option in the US 
 
   -- Immatics to receive upfront payment of $150 million and additional 
      milestone payments of up to $770 million plus tiered double-digit 
      royalties on net product sales 
TUEBINGEN, Germany & HOUSTON & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 14, 2021-- 

Immatics N.V . (NASDAQ: IMTX, ""Immatics""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company active in the discovery and development of T cell-redirecting cancer immunotherapies, and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), today announced that they have entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement (the ""agreement"") for Immatics' TCR Bispecific candidate, IMA401.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211214005182/en/ 

Under the terms of the agreement, Immatics will receive an upfront payment of $150 million as well as up to $770 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalty payments on net sales of IMA401. Immatics retains the options to co-fund U.S. development in exchange for enhanced U.S. royalty payments and/or to co-promote IMA401 in the US.

IMA401 is the most advanced product candidate in Immatics' TCR Bispecifics pipeline, called TCER(R) (T Cell Engaging Receptors), in which one binding region targets MAGEA4/8, a highly prevalent antigen in multiple solid tumors, and the other region engages and activates T cells. In preclinical proof-of-concept studies, IMA401 has shown anti-tumor activity with complete remissions in various in vivo tumor models including patient-derived xenograft models. The agreement outlines a development plan under which both companies will collaborate to advance the program through clinical development.

In November 2021, Immatics filed a Clinical Trial Application (CTA)(1) with Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI), the German federal regulatory authority, for the development of IMA401. The clinical trial, which is planned to commence in the first half of 2022, will enroll patients across various solid tumor types. 


 
(1)    Clinical Trial Application -- the European equivalent of an 
       Investigational New Drug (IND) application 
 

""At Immatics, we are committed to our goal of delivering meaningful clinical benefits to cancer patients, and based on the promising preclinical data, we see remarkable potential for our TCER(R) platform"" said Carsten Reinhardt, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer at Immatics. ""We are delighted to extend our existing collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to the IMA401 program and view this as an important validation of the therapeutic potential of our TCER(R) approach. Bristol Myers Squibb 's global clinical development and commercialization capabilities in oncology make them the ideal partner for the further development of IMA401.""

""We are pleased to expand our collaboration with Immatics to now include IMA401,"" said Teri Foy, Senior Vice President, Research and Early Development, Immuno-Oncology and Cell Therapy at Bristol Myers Squibb . ""TCER(R)s are an important, emerging modality for solid tumors with the potential for cell therapy-like efficacy in an off-the-shelf platform offering potentially broader patient access. We look forward to advancing IMA401 into the clinic to further assess its potential as an innovative medicine to help patients prevail over serious diseases.""

Immatics entered a strategic collaboration in 2019 with Celgene Corporation , a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company , to develop novel adoptive cell therapies. This new collaboration to develop Immatics' Bispecific candidate TCER(R) IMA401 complements ongoing cell therapy activities - both therapeutic modalities built on Immatics' capabilities to identify novel targets and develop high-affinity, target-specific TCRs. The terms of the current agreement regarding Immatics' TCER(R) IMA401 program exclude any MAGEA4/8 targets for cell therapy. The agreement is subject to customary clearance by antitrust regulators.

About IMA401

IMA401 is Immatics' half-life extended TCER(R) molecule that targets an HLA-A*02-presented (human leukocyte antigen) peptide derived from two different cancer-associated proteins, melanoma-associated antigen 4 and/or 8 (""MAGEA4/8""). MAGEA4/8 is highly prevalent in several solid tumor types including squamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, bladder, uterine, esophageal and ovarian carcinomas, as well as melanoma, sarcoma subtypes and other solid cancer types.

About TCER(R)

Immatics' TCER(R) molecules are antibody-like ""off-the-shelf"" biologics that leverage the body's immune system by redirecting and activating T cells towards cancer cells expressing a specific tumor target. To do so, the proprietary biologics are engineered to have two binding regions. The first region contains an affinity- and stability-improved TCR that binds specifically to the cancer target on the cell surface presented by an HLA molecule. The second region is derived from an antibody domain that recruits endogenous T cells to the tumor to become activated. The design of the TCER(R) molecules enables the activation of any T cell in the body to attack the tumor, regardless of the T cells' intrinsic specificity. In addition, the TCER(R) molecule has a Fc-part conferring stability, half-life extension and enhanced manufacturability.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 13, 2021-- 

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E ) crews are responding to local outages from a powerful storm now moving through Northern and Central California.

PG&E has nearly 400 power restoration crews pre-staged, including 278 troublemen, who are the energy company's first responders to an outage. The company has also stockpiled power poles, power lines, transformers, and other electric equipment at yards throughout its service territory to help crews restore power as quickly as possible.

PG&E has activated its Emergency Operations Center and 17 regional and local operations emergency centers to assign staff and resources to the restoration efforts as necessary. In advance of the storm, vegetation-management crews have been working to keep trees and limbs away from powerlines.

Since midnight Sunday, crews have restored power to nearly 16,000 customers. As of 1 p.m. today, about 30,000 customers were experiencing storm-related outages.

PG&E meteorologists, along with experts from the National Weather Service, are predicting gusty winds, widespread rain, heavy mountain snow and isolated thunderstorms will continue across the company's service region through much of the week.

Weather stations reported heavy rainfall and strong winds, with gusts as high as 77 mph in Livermore in Alameda County, and rain accumulation of nearly 10 inches over 48 hours at Middle Peak Mt. Tam in Marin County.

High winds are expected along the Central Coast and Central Valley through early Tuesday with gusts up to 50 mph in some areas. Snow levels in the Sierra Nevada will also be significant above 5,000 feet, with the potential for multiple feet of snow, particularly across the northern end of the range.

PG&E 's meteorology team uses a Storm Outage Prediction Model that incorporates real-time weather forecasts, coupled with 30 years of historical storm data and system knowledge to show where and when storm impacts will be most severe. This model enables the company to pre-stage crews and equipment as storms approach to enable rapid response to outages.

Keeping Customers Informed

PG&E knows how important it is to keep its customers informed. Customers can view real-time outage information on its website outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include in-language support for 16 languages.

Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email or phone. PG&E will inform customers about the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time, and when power is restored.

Storm Safety Tips 


   -- Never touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is 
      energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it--and 
      keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by 
      calling 9-1-1 and by calling PG&E  at 1-800-743-5002. 
 
   -- Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should 
      make sure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a 
      well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant 
      danger to customers, as well as crews working on power lines. If using 
      portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area. 
 
   -- Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated 
      flashlights, and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra 
      batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from 
      drapes, lampshades, animals, and small children. Do not leave candles 
      unattended. 
 
   -- Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires 
      electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan 
      to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having 
      a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running. 
 
   -- Have fresh drinking water, ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with 
      water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your 
      refrigerator/freezer during an outage to prevent foods from spoiling. 
      Blue Ice from your picnic cooler also works well in the freezer. 
 
   -- Secure outdoor furniture: Deck furniture, lightweight yard structures and 
      decorative lawn items should be secured as they can be blown by high 
      winds and damage overhead power lines and property. 
 
   -- Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug, or turn off all 
      electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire 
      hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert 
      you when power returns. Turn your appliances back on one at a time when 
      conditions return to normal. 
 
   -- Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. 
      Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at 
      least two full business days before digging to have all underground 
      utilities safely marked.

""Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril,"" Tedros says. ""Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems."" While some 77 countries have reported cases of Omicron, the variant is probably already present, even if undetected, in most countries, he says. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)

1225 ET - Beyond Meat may debut on more McDonald's menus across the US as soon as 1Q, analysts say. The plant-based meat maker's products can currently be found at eight McDonald's locations as part of a test program. ""The McPlant product with Beyond Meat is performing well at the handful of restaurants offering it, warranting a more expansive market test in early 2022,"" BTIG says. BTIG expects the fast-food chain will likely roll out the McPlant menu in several markets for a limited time. Piper Sandler says the launch could be wider, coming to almost all of McDonald's roughly 14,000 US locations. Piper Sandler raised its 2022 US foodservice revenues target by $35M and now expects Beyond's share price to hit $64 from its previous target of $61. Beyond Meat rises 6.1% to $67.29.

1207 ET - About 74% of respondents expect to increase logistics outsourcing budgets in the next two years, according to Gartner . The survey of 298 supply-chain professionals in the US, Europe and APAC was conducted from March through May. Asked about their top three priorities, most cited improving or updating technology, followed by cost reduction/optimization and increasing customer satisfaction. ""In the face of ongoing disruptions, growing carrier influence and customer selection, shippers and 3PLs must work together to mutually protect their vested interests,"" Gartner 's David Gonzalez says.

1159 ET - With Cabaletta Bio shares plumbing new depths, analysts at Evercore ISI say lackluster signals from the two lowest-dose cohorts in a Phase 1 study of lead candidate DSG3-CAART are disappointing, but not an abject failure. Evercore says expectations about the study had gotten too high, with some investors confusing the company's enthusiasm in a previous update as a nod toward early efficacy rather than a nod toward early safety. The analysts say data from higher-dose cohorts next year should more clearly tell whether Cabaletta's platform is viable in its current iteration or if it needs more work. Evercore keeps its outperform rating on the stock but cuts its price target to $20 from $28. Cabaletta down 70% to $3.73. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

1156 ET - Natural catastrophes hit an estimated $105B globally in 2021, the fourth highest since 1970, says Swiss Re Institute in preliminary estimates. These included a deep winter freeze, floods, severe thunderstorms, heatwaves and a major hurricane. ""Hurricane Ida was the main loss-making event, but once again more than half of the global losses came from secondary perils,"" such as winter storms. The insured losses from natural disasters again exceeded the previous 10-year average. ""Natural catastrophe losses are likely to continue to grow more than global GDP given increases in wealth, urbanisation and climate change,"" the institute says. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

1146 ET - Rising inflation is going to increase the base price of anything transportation related, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says. Though he also says demand is still strong for Uber, ""I do think it's important for us to invest in lower cost product, which is why we have brought back shared rides."" Khosrowshahi, speaking at a UBS event, adds that while higher prices generally are structurally better for Uber's profit margins, ""we're actively making sure that prices are no higher than they should be."" Uber is also working on a strategic portfolio of lower-priced products, which he says should give the company an advantage over its competitors. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1139 ET - Uber has done a lot of acquisitions over the past few years and isn't likely to do many more in the year ahead, the company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi , says at a UBS event. ""We are always looking in the market for opportunities, but right now the hurdle is unusually high,"" he says. ""When I look at 2022, all things being equal, I think there'll be less activity going forward."" Uber's purchases of companies such as Careem, Postmates and Cornershop means the company has a bigger geographical footprint that it can build on organically, he says.

1130 ET - Citi analysts say the FDA 's clinical holds on Merck's studies of islatravir confirms their concerns about the HIV drug candidate that triggered last month's downgrade. Citi already removed islatravir from its model when it cut the stock to neutral, saying it expects Merck to abandon the drug. However, Citi closes its negative catalyst watch on the stock, as it believes the current share price fully discounts the anticipated termination of islatravir, minimizing downward risk. Citi says it expects islatravir's likely demise to further accelerate Merck's business development efforts to address the Keytruda loss of exclusivity in 2028. Merck up 1% to $73.39.

1109 ET - North American freight spending hit a record level in November as shipping rates surged on tight capacity and strong transportation demand. The spending component of the Cass Freight Index rose to 4.275 in November, up 44% year-over-year and an 8% increase from October. Shipping volumes rose 1.4% from October despite persistent backups at US ports, showing progress as transport operators work through distribution bottlenecks, Cass information Systems says. One example: ""recent easing in semiconductor shortages, as shown by improving automotive rail carloadings."" Cass's Truckload Linehaul Index fell sequentially in November as price increases slowed but is projected to keep trending higher. (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

1104 ET - Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says the company's ride-hailing business last week had its strongest performance since the start of the pandemic and is near pre-pandemic levels, even with the spread of the omicron virus variant that he says has had local impacts. ""The mobility business is getting better even in what is a variable environment right now,"" he says at a UBS event. Performance in the current quarter, he says, should come in near the high end of the guidance given last month. Uber shares rise 4% after the CEO's commentary at the event. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com)

1100 ET - Boeing 's net orders were in positive territory for the ninth month in a row as it added deals for 10 during October and scrubbed three, including a MAX and two 787s from Air Lease.

VANCOUVER, BC, Dec. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ - QuestEx Gold & Copper Ltd . (TSXV: QEX) (OTCQX: CLASF) (""QuestEx"" or the ""Company""), is pleased to announce the results of a 24-line-kilometre (""km"") Induced Polarization (""IP"") survey conducted on QuestEx's KSP property, located in British Columbia's prolific Golden Triangle district. The IP survey identified a new top tier porphyry copper-gold exploration target by testing beneath the extensive 8 by 3.5 km Sericite Ridge alteration zone, where it identified an approximately 1,500 by 1,000 metre (""m"") area with coincident high chargeability and high resistivity (Figures 1, 2 and 3), a geophysical signature consistent with porphyry copper-gold systems.

Joe Mullin , QuestEx CEO comments: ""The 31,200 hectare road accessible KSP property, in the heart of British Columbia's prolific Golden Triangle, was the focus of QuestEx's 2021 exploration campaign. We are enthused by the results we have seen from that campaign to date from geophysical work on Sericite Ridge. With the new identification of an impressive porphyry copper-gold target beneath Sericite Ridge, it is clear the KSP property has exciting potential for a multi-target exploration program in 2022.""

Highlights of the Sericite Ridge Porphyry Copper-Gold Target: 


   -- Geological Highlights: 
 
   -- At 8 km long, Sericite Ridge is host to one of the largest alteration 
      zones in the Golden Triangle (Figure 1). 
 
   -- Located in the footwall of the Khyber thrust fault (Figure 1), a setting 
      analogous to other significant deposits in the Golden Triangle including 
      Kerr, Sulphurets, Iron Cap and Saddle North. 
 
   -- Includes the Tami gold showing where gold and copper occur in association 
      with sheeted and stockwork quartz-magnetite-chalcopyrite veins. 
 
   -- Geochemical Highlights: 
 
   -- Three silt samples from streams at the base of Sericite Ridge rank within 
      the 100th percentile for porphyry copper-gold prospectivity within the 
      Golden Triangle according to a 2018 study by Geoscience BC1. 
 
   -- Some of the best historic results at Tami include 2.8 g/t gold (""Au"") and 
      0.48% copper (""Cu"") over 16.0 m in trench 14-006b, and 1.74 g/t Au and 
      0.24% Cu over 40 m in drill hole 17-115 from 5.0 m depth (Figure 1). 
 
   -- Geophysical Highlights: 
 
   -- Newly identified coincident chargeability and resistivity highs covering 
      a 1,500 by 1,000 m area not yet drill-tested below 250 vertical m 
      (Figures 2 and 3). 
 
   -- Three-dimensional (""3D"") model of airborne magnetic data indicates a 
      buried magnetic high associated with the newly identified chargeability 
      and resistivity highs (Figure 2). 

Tony Barresi, QuestEx's President comments: ""Porphyry copper-gold deposits in the Golden Triangle and around the world have geophysical signatures comparable to what we are seeing at Sericite Ridge. Sericite Ridge has long been recognized as having porphyry copper-gold potential, but previous drilling focused on near surface copper and gold mineralization or shallow magnetic anomalies. The Induced Polarization survey conducted this year has identified a truly 'porphyry-sized' target, shallowly buried, in the middle of the impressively large Sericite Ridge alteration zone. This is a first-order porphyry target with all the signature geology, geophysics and geochemistry characteristics, and located in the heart of a district that hosts some of the world's largest porphyry copper-gold deposits.""

2021 Induced Polarization Survey -- Sericite Ridge

A 24-line-km IP survey was conducted by Peter E. Walcott and Associates Ltd. (""Walcott"") over the Sericite Ridge alteration zone. The eight-channel, pole-dipole, IP survey was configured with eight 200 m spaced lines, with the longest line (4.3 km) running roughly along the ridge crest (Figure 1). Chargeability and resistivity data from the survey are interpreted to a vertical depth of approximately 350 m. The survey detected shallow chargeability anomalies associated with the Tami copper-gold prospect on the southern end of the survey area, as well as several other shallow chargeability anomalies that have not been tested by drilling. The primary porphyry copper-gold target identified by the survey is outlined by an approximately 1,500 by 1,000 m coincident chargeability and resistivity anomaly with portions that register greater than 90 mV/V chargeability and 10,000 ohm-m resistivity (Figures 2 and 3). Beneath the ridgetop the anomaly intensifies at a depth of approximately 220 m but survey lines along the eastern flanks of the ridge identify continuations of the anomaly at depths less than 50 m. 3D inversions of airborne magnetic geophysical data indicate magnetic high anomalies at approximately the same depths as the chargeability and resistivity highs. Only two historical drill holes test the coincident anomalies, DDH18-147 and DDH18-150. These holes bottomed in the outer shell of the chargeability high and drill logs from both holes record a doubling of the sulphide content to 4-5% at the bottom of the holes. In DDH18-150, the increased sulphide content was accompanied by an increase in gold and copper grades, bottoming at 285 m in 0.2 g/t Au and 0.036% Cu over 2 m (Figure 3).

Sericite Ridge

Sericite Ridge is located near the centre of the KSP property and is more accessible than most other showings on the property due to its lower elevation and proximity to QuestEx's road accessible core logging facility. The ridge lies in the immediate footwall of the Khyber thrust fault and comprises a north-northeast oriented roof pendant of Stuhini Group (Triassic) sedimentary and volcanic rocks within the Lehto Batholith. Mapping conducted by the British Columbia Geological Survey(2) identified the 8 by 3.5 km Sericite Ridge alteration zone as encompassing the roof pendant and portions of the surrounding Lehto Batholith. The alteration consists mainly of strong to intense sericite and chlorite dominant facies with localized domains of strong silicification.

There are at least eight named mineral showings across Sericite Ridge, and each is associated with porphyry dykes and/or north-northeast or east-west oriented faults. The most advanced showing is Tami, which is outlined by a 1,000 by 220 m gold and copper in soil anomaly and has previously been tested by 6,261 m of drilling in 40 shallow drill holes. Tami is an at-surface, fault-imbricated, porphyry-related, mineral system with sheeted and stockwork quartz-magnetite-chalcopyrite veins. It is associated with a localized domain of high chargeability, resistivity and magnetic susceptibility and may represent a faulted, or higher-level fault controlled, portion of the larger and more intense coincident anomalies that have now been identified at depth to the northeast of Tami.

Sericite Ridge was considered a high potential porphyry copper-gold target by previous explorers (e.g. Homestake Mining Co .), however, the size of the overall alteration system made targeting difficult, so exploration focused on the Tami zone where mineralization is exposed at surface. QuestEx's 2021 IP survey over Sericite Ridge has delineated previously unrecognized porphyry copper-gold targets that the Company intends to drill in 2022.

The IP data presented in this news release is preliminary and based on chargeability and resistivity cross-sections provided by Walcott. QuestEx expects to receive more detailed interpretations of the data including a 3D inversion model early in 2022. The full set of chargeability and resistivity cross-sections are available on the Company's website.

Inel Update

A 2,418 m, 13 drill hole exploration campaign was conducted in 2021 on the Inel Gold prospect, which is also located on the KSP property, approximately 4 km west of Sericite Ridge. The Company expects to begin releasing drill results from Inel in early January 2022, and to announce an inaugural National Instrument (""NI"") 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for Inel by the end of Q1, 2022.

Half of respondents indicated they expected annual inflation to rise 5%-plus over the next six months; three-quarters of executives surveyed indicated either they expected supply-chain disruptions to either deteriorate further or remain the same; and 54% suggested labor shortages were hampering investment plans. The survey was conducted between Nov. 10 and Nov. 24, and with the results the confidence index fell 19 points to 85.6 -- down from a 104.6 reading in August, or the highest level in 15 years.

0942 ET - Ubisoft Entertainment says its chief studios operating officer is leaving the videogame company to pursue other activities. Virginie Haas had served in the position for 16 months after three years as an independent board director. Her departure follows that of several other Ubisoft executives since mid-2020, when the company said it was investigating allegations of misconduct. Ubisoft in May announced it had taken steps to make its workplace more inclusive but a group of current and former employees says the company hasn't done enough. The group, called ABetterUbisoft, announced on Saturday that 13,000 people have signed an online petition demanding more change. Ubisoft shares off roughly 2%.

0823 ET - Jefferies remains positive on the integrated oil-and-gas sector in 2022, and says that its favorite companies within the industry are those with the best combination of free cash flow generation and natural-gas exposure. This is because the gas market is expected to remain incredibly tight, with prices above $10 per million British thermal units through 2025. Therefore, Jefferies recommends companies with higher gas price leverage to either European spot markets--Equinor and OMV--or the liquefied natural gas market--Shell and TotalEnergies . Overall, Jefferies expects the sector to generate 65% of its current market capitalization as free cash flow over the next five years, leaving material upside to shareholder remuneration.

0805 ET - Two months after its planned $1.2B union with vertical farming company AeroFarms fell apart, blank-check company Spring Valley Acquisition says it will combine with nuclear small modular reactor technology company NuScale Power in a deal worth $1.9B. Spring Valley, which raised more than $200M late last year amid a record boom in special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in October said it had mutually agreed to call off its merger with AeroFarms parent Dream Holdings after Dream determined that the deal wasn't in the best interests of its holders. Spring Valley, which faced a dissolution deadline in May 2022, says it will now merge with NuScale, whose majority owner Fluor Corp . will hold 60% of the combined company. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)

SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 14, 2021-- 

Franklin Templeton today announced plans to convert two mutual funds to ETFs. Each of BrandywineGLOBAL - Dynamic US Large Cap Value Fund and Martin Currie International Sustainable Equity Fund has longer than a 5-year track record and top quartile Morningstar performance.(1) The conversions, subject to shareholder approval, are expected to be effective in the third or fourth quarter of 2022.

""The addition of these new ETFs would expand our line up in the actively managed U.S. large cap value and international growth spaces, where we have strong investment capabilities among our specialist investment managers.""

Patrick O'Connor, Head of Global ETFs for Franklin Templeton , said, ""Active ETFs have experienced phenomenal growth, with a 3-year compound annual AUM growth rate of 63%.(2) We believe that client demand will continue to increase as investors seek active insights combined with the benefits of the ETF structure. With these ETF conversions, we are best leveraging the capabilities of our diversified investment management teams to meet the evolving needs of our clients.""

Important Information

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Fixed-income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. High yield bonds are subject to greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. A managers' environmental social and governance (ESG) investment strategies may limit the types and number of investment opportunities available and, as a result, may underperform strategies that are not subject to such criteria. Active management does not ensure gains or protect against market declines.

Before investing, carefully consider a Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You can find this and other information in each prospectus, or summary prospectus, if available, which is available at www.franklintempleton.com. Please read it carefully.

"Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ",",ccat,neqac,nfiac,ncat,nfact,",,1639516490000,"Like other firms, Wells Fargo's compensation plan includes a cash component as well as deferred pay, which vests at a later date.

Among other changes, Wells Fargo is simplifying its two-tier, three-hurdle approach to monthly cash pay for its financial advisors. Under the new plan, advisors will be paid 22% for every dollar of monthly revenue they generate below $13,500 and 50% for each dollar above that threshold. Previously, advisors had the same two pay rates, but faced three monthly hurdles ($12,500, $13,500 and $14,250); if advisors achieved certain criteria, they could move to a lower hurdle. The three hurdles had been a feature of Wells Fargo's compensation plan dating back to 2014, executives say.

Wells Fargo is the last of the wirehouses to disclose 2022 changes to its annual compensation plan. Merrill Lynch, UBS, and Morgan Stanley unveiled tweaks and adjustments in recent weeks.

Across the industry, advisor compensation plans are typically designed to incentivize behavior through the use of bonuses and other features. Wells Fargo executives say their plan was due for simplification. And feedback from advisors, they say, played a big part in the redesign.

""One thing we heard from advisors over the last couple of years is that our plan had started out simple, but over time it became more and more complex, and they told us it's just too complex,"" says John Alexander,

head of the divisional network at Wells Fargo Advisors, the bank's retail brokerage unit.

Plus, the differences between the three hurdles under the outgoing compensation plan were ""kinda minimal,"" Egan adds. ""So it was complicated, and there wasn't really enough there to incentivize people.""

Advisors have an opportunity under next year's plan to earn a 50% payout on their entire monthly production, provided they meet certain criteria: have 12-month trailing revenue of at least $2 million; have year-over-year revenue growth of $150,000 or more; and be on a team that shares 75% or more of the group's total revenue with its members.

On deferred compensation, Wells Fargo removed caps on the maximum payout for a net asset flow award and on a bonus for mortgage lending revenue and securities-based lending revenue.

The net asset flow award relates to net new money that advisors bring to the firm, from existing and new clients. To be eligible for it, an advisor needs to be generating at least $400,000 in annual revenue. The advisor can earn 0.2% of net asset flows of between $2 million and $5 million, and 0.5% of flows of $5 million or more.

""We are well aware that clients have assets held away from us,"" Alexander says. ""We believe that we provide clients great service, and we think this will incentivize advisors to ask them about those assets.""

""Financial advisors who do really well on this metric have an uncapped opportunity,"" Egan adds.

Deferred compensation bonuses for total revenue generated and length of service remain unchanged.

Wells Fargo also unveiled compensation plan changes for its bank-channel based financial advisors, who are compensated based on different criteria than their colleagues in the company's traditional wirehouse unit. Wells Fargo previously offered bank channel advisors two bonuses for clients based on whether the client was a referral from within Wells Fargo are sourced by the advisor alone. Under the new plan, there's a single bonus for acquiring new clients.

Wells Fargo did not change the core compensation grid for its bank channel advisors, who can earn a higher payout rate by generating more revenue.

Executives hope the compensation plan tweaks will help the firm boost business.

""We are focused on growing the Wealth & Investment Management business, which we'll do by attracting and retaining the best advisors in the business, increasing net asset flows, and increasing lending balances,"" Barry Sommers, CEO of Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo, said in a statement.

The pullback is in some ways reminiscent of September, when the Delta variant forced numerous companies to cancel their return-to-office plans, upending hopes that there would be a major back-to-office surge following Labor Day.

A reduction in the number of employees returning to work next month would be painful for office-building landlords who have been struggling with high vacancy and uncertainty over the long-term impact of the pandemic. Some analysts suggested that another delayed return to the office would cause more employers to consider remote work longer term.

""The big risk would be if these companies now take a bigger step towards a more work-from-home world,"" said Daniel Ismail, senior analyst at real-estate-analytics firm Green Street.

Sales at restaurants, bars and other small businesses near office buildings have suffered for nearly two years, causing these operators to scramble to make rent payments and keep their operations alive. Some are already reconciling themselves to a poor start to the new year.

""January gets pushed back to February. February will get pushed back to March,"" said Rick Passarelli, owner of a Bobby Van's steakhouse in Midtown Manhattan. ""It keeps getting pushed back.""

While less than half of the office workers have returned in major urban markets, landlords take some solace knowing that the number continues to edge higher. An average of 41% of the workforce was back in the 10 major cities monitored by Kastle Systems in the week after Thanksgiving, a record level since the pandemic hit. Kastle is a nationwide security company that monitors access-card swipes in 10 large cities.

And landlords remain hopeful that any retreat from the office won't be as severe as it was before Labor Day. For one, more Americans are vaccinated now. Currently about 82% of the U.S. population ages 12 and up has had at least one dose, and the rate is much higher in cities such as New York and San Francisco, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . That compares to only around 62% of the eligible population as the country headed into the Labor Day weekend, the CDC said.

Some businesses also are taking cues from President Biden, who has said no new lockdowns are necessary due to the Omicron variant. He has limited new restrictions mostly to travel rules. Many public events, from football games to Broadway shows, are proceeding.

Wells Fargo & Co . is among the firms pledging to return as planned next month. The bank said last month that it ""will continue to follow the science,"" and it is on track to open its San Francisco headquarters and other locations.

Businesses also recognize that lurching from one workplace strategy to another before the health data support such moves creates uncertainty and hurts credibility, said Kathryn Wylde , chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.

""It's been back and forth so many times,"" Ms. Wylde said. ""Every one of those reversals increases the lack of trust that anybody knows the right thing to do.""

That concern isn't stopping some companies from delaying or tinkering with their return schedules. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc . said it put off plans to bring its senior leadership team to the downtown Hartford, Conn., office during the first week in December. The company said it is still moving forward with a Jan. 18 return-to-office for employees.

Meta Platforms Inc ., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., said last week it would fully reopen its U.S. offices at the end of January. But it also said it was implementing a new office deferral program that gives workers the option to delay their scheduled return as late as June.

Other companies have indicated they might delay plans based on new findings related to the Omicron variant. Pfizer Inc . and BioNTech SE said last week that a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests but the two-dose regimen was less effective at blocking the virus.

1146 ET - Rising inflation is going to increase the base price of anything transportation related, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says. Though he also says demand is still strong for Uber, ""I do think it's important for us to invest in lower cost product, which is why we have brought back shared rides."" Khosrowshahi, speaking at a UBS event, adds that while higher prices generally are structurally better for Uber's profit margins, ""we're actively making sure that prices are no higher than they should be."" Uber is also working on a strategic portfolio of lower-priced products, which he says should give the company an advantage over its competitors. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com; @saraheneedleman)

1139 ET - Uber has done a lot of acquisitions over the past few years and isn't likely to do many more in the year ahead, the company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi , says at a UBS event. ""We are always looking in the market for opportunities, but right now the hurdle is unusually high,"" he says. ""When I look at 2022, all things being equal, I think there'll be less activity going forward."" Uber's purchases of companies such as Careem, Postmates and Cornershop means the company has a bigger geographical footprint that it can build on organically, he says.

1130 ET - Citi analysts say the FDA 's clinical holds on Merck's studies of islatravir confirms their concerns about the HIV drug candidate that triggered last month's downgrade. Citi already removed islatravir from its model when it cut the stock to neutral, saying it expects Merck to abandon the drug. However, Citi closes its negative catalyst watch on the stock, as it believes the current share price fully discounts the anticipated termination of islatravir, minimizing downward risk. Citi says it expects islatravir's likely demise to further accelerate Merck's business development efforts to address the Keytruda loss of exclusivity in 2028. Merck up 1% to $73.39.

1109 ET - North American freight spending hit a record level in November as shipping rates surged on tight capacity and strong transportation demand. The spending component of the Cass Freight Index rose to 4.275 in November, up 44% year-over-year and an 8% increase from October. Shipping volumes rose 1.4% from October despite persistent backups at US ports, showing progress as transport operators work through distribution bottlenecks, Cass information Systems says. One example: ""recent easing in semiconductor shortages, as shown by improving automotive rail carloadings."" Cass's Truckload Linehaul Index fell sequentially in November as price increases slowed but is projected to keep trending higher. (jennifer.smith@wsj.com)

1104 ET - Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says the company's ride-hailing business last week had its strongest performance since the start of the pandemic and is near pre-pandemic levels, even with the spread of the omicron virus variant that he says has had local impacts. ""The mobility business is getting better even in what is a variable environment right now,"" he says at a UBS event. Performance in the current quarter, he says, should come in near the high end of the guidance given last month. Uber shares rise 4% after the CEO's commentary at the event. (sarah.needleman@wsj.com)

1035 ET - Currys investors are likely to study first-half results on Wednesday for any signs that the electrical-goods retailer may beat full-year profit expectations. Numis Securities expects the company formerly known as Dixons Carphone to beat 2021-22 consensus pretax profit estimates of about GBP170 million, with the brokerage forecasting GBP195 million. ""1H should provide evidence of that,"" Numis analyst Simon Bowler says.

Also critical will be commentary on current trading, given the importance of peak trading."" (philip.waller@wsj.com)

1012 ET - Shell 's customer-led, rather than capacity-led, energy transition strategy reduces the risk of the company using a high proportion of free cash flow for transformative acquisitions, Jefferies says. In addition, at current forward price curves, Shell will return 90% of its market capitalization as free cash flows over the next five years, supporting the case for one of the highest shareholder remuneration upsides in the sector. The Anglo-Dutch company also has one of the highest exposures to natural gas, a market which is expected to remain tight through 2025 and whose demand will continue to grow well past peak oil consumption, Jefferies says. The bank has a buy rating on Shell . (jaime.llinares@wsj.com)

1002 ET - Stagecoach Group shares jump 8% after the Scotland-based bus company and rival National Express Group said they had agreed to an all-share merger, creating a company worth around 1.9 billion pounds ($2.51 billion). In a research note Tuesday summarizing the details of the tie-up, Citigroup pointed to comments it made earlier this year about the likelihood of further consolidation within the U.K. regional bus market. ""We see operators with a bigger footprint playing a pivotal role in the post-pandemic recovery and the market-share data at the sub-regional levels offer scope for further consolidation,"" Citi analysts say. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0952 ET - In 2021, integrated oil companies generated the highest free cash flow in over a decade, Jefferies says. FCF is expected to remain close to this level in 2022 which should lead to further shareholder remuneration upside, the bank says. ""With these levels of FCF, we see scope for further increases of dividends and buybacks at 4Q21 results and throughout 2022."" However, high cash generation and normalized leverage levels increase the risk that companies might turn to large-scale acquisitions to accelerate their low-carbon transition and secure pipelines to meet long-term targets, Jefferies says, noting that BP seems particularly exposed to this trend given its high renewable-energy capacity targets.

1159 ET - With Cabaletta Bio shares plumbing new depths, analysts at Evercore ISI say lackluster signals from the two lowest-dose cohorts in a Phase 1 study of lead candidate DSG3-CAART are disappointing, but not an abject failure. Evercore says expectations about the study had gotten too high, with some investors confusing the company's enthusiasm in a previous update as a nod toward early efficacy rather than a nod toward early safety. The analysts say data from higher-dose cohorts next year should more clearly tell whether Cabaletta's platform is viable in its current iteration or if it needs more work. Evercore keeps its outperform rating on the stock but cuts its price target to $20 from $28. Cabaletta down 70% to $3.73.

The computer maker had argued Oracle 's moves violated terms of a settlement associated with its hiring of former Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd . The payment of roughly $4.65B, with interest, drove Oracle to a loss in the most recent quarter. ""We continue to believe that errors were made in the proceedings and intend to petition the US Supreme Court to challenge the judgment amount,"" Oracle says in its quarterly report filed with the SEC. HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise , born from the 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard , shared the judgment's net proceeds. HP , which said Oracle has until Dec. 28 to file a petition for review with the Supreme Court, believes the likelihood that damages would be reduced or reversed is remote.

1627 ET - Canadian stocks close lower in the last session of the week with all sectors down except health services. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index falls 0.2% to 20890, and the blue-chip S&P/TSX 60 Index declines 0.1% to 1268.

1624 ET - The White House alleges the meat industry is raising prices and increasing their profit margins beyond just covering the cost of inflation, the Biden Administration says in a Friday blog post. ""The meat price increases we are seeing are not just the natural consequences of supply and demand in a free market,"" the post says. ""The November Consumer Price Index data released this morning demonstrates that meat prices are still the single largest contributor to the rising cost of food."" The North American Meat Institute retorts that the White House is just shifting blame for record food inflation. ""This argument is simply a rinse and repeat of their September attempts to blame meat and poultry companies for inflation that is not limited to food, but is being felt across the economy,"" the group says.

1619 ET - Canadian officials sent a letter to US members of Congress on Friday threatening retaliatory tariffs if the US goes ahead with a plan to give consumers a tax write-off if they buy American-built electric vehicles. Canada's finance minister and trade minister wrote in the letter that if the plan goes ahead, Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs against US exports and launch a dispute settlement process under USMCA, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade. They said Canada could also stop abiding by the concessions it agreed to in negotiating USMCA, which include limits on Canadian dairy exports to the US. (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael)

1612 ET - The 10-year Treasury yield scores its highest one-week gain since February, as Covid-19 fears ebb and markets brace for further monetary tightening. The benchmark barely moved today and remained below the 1.50% mark, but it gained 0.145 percentage point during the week, to 1.487%. The 30-year yield, in turn, had the largest weekly gain since January, adding 0.208 p.p. to 1.883% and snapping a three-week losing streak. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1607 ET - US stocks gain after data showed inflation at a 39-year high of 6.8% for November. Despite that high, that figure was in line with expectations and investors are watching to see if it will affect the Fed's timeline for reducing stimulus. Oracle jumps 16% after results beat consensus. Broadcom advances 7.6% on better than expected results and robust guidance for its January quarter. The Dow rises 0.6% to 35970, the S&P 500 rises nearly 1% to a record 4712 and the Nasdaq adds 0.7% to 15630. All three gain more than 3% for the week, with the S&P and Nasdaq completing their best week since February and the Dow since March. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1602 ET - Royal Dutch Shell Chairman Andrew Mackenzie said he doesn't believe that the company's move to simplify its share structure and relocate headquarters to the U.K. would have any impact on a Dutch court ruling that found Shell partially responsible for climate change and ordered it to reduce carbon emissions by 45% (from 2019 levels) by the end of 2030. While Shell is appealing the judgment, ""we're also making best efforts to comply with its expectations,"" he said Friday at the company's shareholder meeting, according to a transcript. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden , Mackenzie said, didn't attend the meeting because he was sick. Mackenzie said the CEO had tested negative for Covid-19 but a decision was made for him not to attend the meeting physically or virtually. (maria.armental@wsj.com)

1445 ET - Peloton Interactive drops 6.6% to $37.99 a day after the company's namesake bike made an unflattering cameo on the newly released ""Sex and the City"" revival. But as upset as some people were over the fictional incident, the stock dive is likely a coincidence. Credit Suisse earlier today slashed its price target for Peloton to $50 from $112 on concerns of slowing growth. (sharon.terlep@wsj.com)

1427 ET - JPMorgan now expects the Federal Reserve to raise rates earlier than it once did, and is eyeing a June rate hike over its prior view that a liftoff would happen in September, the investment bank says. The bank expects quarterly rate rises after that. JPMorgan also expects the Fed to follow through on its chatter and accelerate the pace of its bond buying taper process. The Fed will take ""the monthly reduction in the purchase pace from $15 billion per month to $30 billion per month [which] keeps the math simple, and results in a mid-March end to asset purchases,"" it says, adding that ""any tapering announcement will be conveyed in the post-meeting statement, and we expect it will reiterate the option to adjust the pace in response to changing developments.""

1149 ET - Moderna falls 6.6% on investors' disappointment in the company's early clinical-trial results for an experimental seasonal influenza vaccine. Morgan Stanley says the flu shot's inducement of immune-system antibodies against flu strains was in line with what a licensed shot, Sanofi 's Fluzone, could achieve. ""We believe the market was looking for data which supported clearly better efficacy,"" the firm says. Leerink says study subjects had side effects that could make Moderna's shot less appealing. Sanofi gains 3.7%. (peter.loftus@wsj.com; @Loftus)

1125 ET - Improved prices for farm commodities like corn and soybeans have been fueling a surge in farmers paying off debts they may have amassed during the extended downturn of previous years, the Kansas City Fed says. The Fed says the volume of delinquent farm loans has dropped 30% to 40% from this time last year. ""The quick turnaround in repayment issues led to the lowest rate of delinquency on farm loans for the third quarter since 2015,"" the Fed says. However, the general slowdown in taking out loans may soon end, the central bank says. ""Input costs have risen considerably in recent months, which is likely to increase credit needs and weigh on profit margins going forward."" (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

Other high-profile insiders -- including the Walton family, heirs to the Walmart Inc. fortune, and Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. -- have accelerated sales and are on track to break recent records for the number of shares they have sold.

Across the S&P 500, insiders have sold a record $63.5 billion in shares through November, a 50% increase from all of 2020, driven both by stock-market gains and an increase in sales by some big holders. The technology sector has led with $41 billion in sales across the entire market, up by more than a third, with a smaller amount but an even-bigger rise in financial services.

""What you're seeing is unprecedented"" in recent years, said Daniel Taylor, an accounting professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies trading by executives and directors. He said 2021 marks the most sales he can recall by insiders in a decade, resembling waves of sales during the twilight of the early 2000s dot-com boom.

Insiders have a long history of selling at peaks and buying in troughs, Mr. Taylor said.

Investors sometimes worry that large sales by insiders mean they don't expect significant further share-price increases, and big, unexpected sales can weigh on share prices. Companies often require top executives to hold stakes equal to several times their annual salary, but many high-profile executives easily exceed those thresholds even after selling.

Executives aren't required to say why they sold, and few do. The heaviest selling came as lawmakers in Washington hashed out potential tax increases as part of the Democrats' Build Back Better legislative package, at times considering raising the long-term capital-gains tax rate. In November, insiders unloaded a collective $15.59 billion.

The legislation, pending in the Senate, imposes a 5% tax on adjusted gross income above $10 million beginning in 2022, and an additional 3% on income over $25 million, including capital gains from stock sales. Congressional revenue estimates assume taxpayers will accelerate capital gains in 2021. Wealthy taxpayers could save up to $8 million in taxes on every $100 million of shares sold ahead of the effective date, Mr. Taylor said. Such potential tax savings have been ""a powerful incentive to sell this year,"" he said.

Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, considered the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $270 billion, ridiculed a proposed tax on billionaires' unrealized capital gains, saying on Twitter that eventually the government runs ""out of other people's money and then they come for you."" He has moved to sell more than $10 billion in Tesla stock over about a month -- including roughly $4 billion to cover tax withholding on option exercises -- in his first sale of company shares since 2010, other than sales designated as made solely to satisfy tax-withholding obligations.

Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella in November sold half of his total stake, for about $374 million before taxes. Some analysts said the move could be related to Washington state instituting a 7% tax for long-term capital gains next year. A Microsoft spokesman said at the time that the sale was for ""personal financial planning and diversification reasons."" Another spike in insider-stock sales occurred in May when company leaders sold off $13.12 billion in shares, following strong corporate earnings reports.

The Journal examined data on company leaders' stock transactions through Dec. 3, drawn from regulatory filings by InsiderScore. Sales marked as made solely to satisfy tax withholding rules were excluded. Aggregate figures, through Nov. 30, exclude sales by major shareholders who aren't also executives or directors.

About a dozen high-profile founders and CEOs sold millions of dollars in company shares this year after selling none in all of 2020, in several cases selling for the first time in five or 10 years.

Messrs. Page and Brin last sold stock in Google parent Alphabet Inc. at about $800 a share in 2017, according to InsiderScore. When they returned to the market in May, shares had risen to $2,200 each. This year, they have each sold nearly 600,000 shares for about $1.5 billion before taxes. Each still owns about 6% of Alphabet, according to FactSet.

The duo's sales came as the company reported record revenue and profit more than doubled from a year earlier, and seven months after the Justice Department and state attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Google. The company's share price reached a record $3,019.33 on Nov. 19, and has since pulled back to about $2,950.

An Alphabet spokesman declined to comment. Messrs. Brin and Page didn't respond to a request to comment.

Mr. Lauder, the son of Estee Lauder Cos.' founders, has shed just over two million shares this year, for more than $600 million before taxes in his first sales since 2016.

Dell Technologies Inc.'s Michael Dell and the Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein also came off the sidelines over the past year. Mr. Dell sold five million shares for nearly $253 million before taxes, his first since taking Dell public again in 2018. Mr. Rubenstein sold 11 million shares this year for $495 million before taxes, after making his first-ever sale in November 2020. His sales have followed him stepping aside as co-CEO and transitioning into a role as co-chairman.

A spokesman for Mr. Lauder declined to comment. Spokespeople for Mr. Dell didn't respond to requests to comment.

Other insiders continued selling but at a faster clip this year. The Walton family quadrupled the number of shares its members sold, receiving $6.5 billion before taxes so far in 2021, from $1.5 billion in 2020. The sales came in a year when Walmart's share price flirted with records, and the company posted higher sales in three quarters.

Mr. Zuckerberg increased the number of Meta shares he sold nearly sevenfold from a year ago, collecting nearly $4.5 billion before taxes. His selling came as the company reported record sales and earnings, despite challenges presented by iPhone privacy changes and congressional hearings over harms from its platforms following the Journal's Facebook Files series.

Walmart and Meta spokespeople said the sales are generally governed by preset trading plans. They said the Walton family's proceeds help fund nonprofit initiatives, and Mr. Zuckerberg's fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, his family's for-profit philanthropic company.

""People are clearly being opportunistic,"" said Ben Silverman, InsiderScore's director of research.

The key highlight for 2022 is softer production guidance for nearly all divisions and modestly higher costs, RBC says. Copper production is expected to be better in 2023 and 2024, indicating an improved Chile production profile versus the bank's forecasts. As for capital expenditure, the outlook is 18% higher than expectations for 2023 and ""materially higher"" for 2024. ""At the margin, the details in the three-year forward guidance point towards a more clear eroding of expectations, albeit nothing that alters the fundamentally attractive underlying investment case,"" RBC says.

1158 GMT - Recent momentum should continue next year for French luxury-goods giant LVMH , as the core fashion division continues to lead the charge and travel retail picks up, Bryan Garnier's Loic Morvan says. Sales should grow by 10% in 2022, BG says, raising its estimate from 8% previously. Top-line impetus will be driven by the fashion & leather-goods division and also by recovery in travel retail after a tough couple of pandemic-hit years. Recent signing Tiffany should meanwhile boost revenue at the watches & jewelry division, and the group operating margin should reach 26.2%, with higher earnings as a result, Morvan says. BG raises its target price on LVMH stock to ERU800 from EUR750, keeping a top-pick buy rating. (joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)

1154 GMT - LVMH should maintain the pace of sales growth in the year's final quarter, with performance at the hard-luxury division notably stepping up, Bryan Garnier analyst Loic Morvan says ahead of the French group's 2021 update next month. Compared with the same period of 2019, 4Q sales should rise some 12%, according to BG 's estimates, compared with 11% in the previous quarter. The fashion division should maintain the pace of growth seen in 3Q, but watch & jewelry sales should pick up, rising 4% over two years compared with 1% in 3Q, thanks to better performance in Asia, especially for jeweler Bulgari, Morvan adds.

1130 GMT - Merck KGaA 's updated forecasts better reflect an improving outlook across all divisions, Citi says. The German company's life-sciences and electronic divisions will likely remain the key near-term share-price drivers. Also, with governments set to push for higher Covid-19 vaccination rates and accelerated booster programs, life sciences is expected to perform at the very top or ahead of guidance, according to the analysts. The division has had revenue and margins consistently surprising to the upside over the past couple of years, and the electronics business is seen emulating this narrative, Citi says.

1101 GMT - European stocks fall as renewed worries about the Omicron coronavirus variant dampen market sentiment and as investors look ahead to U.S. inflation data later. The Stoxx Europe 600 drops 0.2%, the FTSE 100 declines 0.1%, the DAX decreases 0.2% and the CAC 40 sheds 0.3%. Meal-kit provider HelloFresh falls 4.6% as it continues to reel after Wednesday's weaker-than-expected earnings guidance. Investors are cautious, especially after news that Omicron spreads faster than the Delta variant, ActivTrades analyst Pierre Veyret says. They are also awaiting the U.S. inflation report at 1330 GMT, which is considered ""highly important by most market operators as it could give significant hints on what the Federal Reserve may do"" at next Wednesday's policy meeting, he says.

1058 GMT - Norway's CPI-ATE, CPI adjusted for tax changes excluding energy products, was marginally on the upside with the on-year rate rising to 1.3% from 0.9%, against consensus of 1.2%, SEB says. ""There is strong reason to believe that core inflation has reached a trough, and we expect CPI-ATE to gradually rise over the next 12 months and we see upside risk to Norges Bank 's inflation trajectory,"" it says. Headline CPI jumped to 5.1% on year, far above expectations, and indicators imply that prices will rise even more in December with inflation possibly even temporarily reaching 7% on-year, SEB adds. ""Norges Bank focuses on core inflation, but high electricity prices are squeezing households' purchasing power and will weigh on near-term growth,"" it says. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

1049 GMT - Indian shares were little changed, with the benchmark Sensex closing 20.46 points lower at 58786.67. Investor sentiment was weighed by Omicron- and Chinese-developer-related fears, Oanda senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley says. Apparent defaults from Evergrande and Kaisa along with weaker U.S. shares overnight sent Asian equity markets lower Friday, with Indian stocks taking cues from regional peers, Halley adds. Losses were broad based, with Titan Co . down 1.4%, Housing Development Finance Corp . 1.1% lower and Axis Bank declining 0.9%. (yongchang.chin@wsj.com)

1047 GMT - Headline inflation reached a 13-year high in November, but core CPI-ATE was more subdued and is likely to remain below Norges Bank 's target throughout 2022, Capital Economics says. The increase in CPI-ATE--which excludes energy prices and tax changes--to 1.3% in November still left it below Norges Bank 's 2.0% target. The effects of a stronger krone are likely to keep core inflation low, potentially turning negative in early 2022, it adds. ""Today's data are unlikely to have too much of an influence on next week's policy meeting...we think that the Norges Bank will hike rates to 0.50%."" However, the spread of Omicron and new restrictions poses downside risks to CE's forecast of four 25 basis point rate increases in 2022, it says. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

1045 GMT - Bayer 's win in a California trial regarding its weedkiller Roundup is a significant development, coming after the company won an earlier trial in October, UBS says. The German company had provisioned $9.8 billion for the approximately 125,000 plaintiffs, of which more than 20,000 haven't agreed to settlement terms, UBS says. This last case, which represented a plaintiff named Donetta Stephens, could give the ""hold-outs"" an incentive not to enter the settlement agreement, as the odds of losing have now increased, according to the bank. More importantly, this trial win could increase investor confidence that Bayer 's $6.5 billion provision for future cases is adequate, UBS says. Bayer trades up 1.8% at EUR46.61.

1030 GMT - Hilton Food Group 's acquisition of Dutch salmon business Foppen looks strategically and financially attractive, RBC Capital Markets says. The food-packing business will partially fund the acquisition through a GBP75 million share placing, which will put pressure on the shares in the near term, but this will be offset in the long run by the attractiveness of the deal, RBC says. ""[The deal] complements its existing seafood business and therefore provides revenue synergies. Despite the placing, it will be [earnings] accretive in the first twelve months and Hilton notes return on invested capital is greater than the cost of capital,"" the Canadian bank says. Retains outperform rating and 1,500 pence price target. Shares are down 0.8% at 1,186.0 pence. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

1015 GMT - HelloFresh 's target for adjusted Ebitda next year is below market expectations, but 2022 should be seen as a one-off year for the German meal-kit maker's earnings margin, Bryan Garnier says. HelloFresh targets 2022 adjusted Ebitda between EUR500 million and EUR580 million. Bryan Garnier estimates a margin decline of 180 basis points to 7.3% for 2022. ""The extent of the Ebitda margin decline in 2022 is surprising, but should be seen as a one-off. Underlying business profitability is not under pressure but 2022 will be another year of investments, after 2021,"" the European investment bank says. HelloFresh shares trade 4.7% lower at EUR74.64.

MELBOURNE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 20, 2021-- 

L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) completed the final major design milestone on the U.S. Missile Defense Agency 's (MDA ) Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) program Phase IIb On-orbit Prototype Demonstration and has already begun building the demonstration satellite.

Completing the CDR is the final design milestone ensuring performance, cost and schedule requirements can be met before beginning to build the satellite. However, L3Harris has been building and buying components concurrently to maintain an aggressive schedule.

""L3Harris is moving quickly, in collaboration with our customer, to provide prototype HBTSS satellites that demonstrate the sensitivity and fire control quality of service necessary to support the hypersonic kill chain,"" said Ed Zoiss , president, L3Harris Space & Airborne Systems. ""Recent events with China and Russia increase the urgency to counter hypersonics and advanced maneuvering threats.""

HBTSS is one of several proposed systems within the Department of Defense's next-generation proliferated low-Earth orbit space architecture. The program's objective is to demonstrate the capability to detect and track traditional and emerging missile threats using infrared sensors and advanced processing capability.

L3Harris has prioritized investments in end-to-end satellite solutions in spacecraft, payloads, ground software and advanced algorithms. The Missile Defense Agency awarded L3Harris a study contract in 2019 and the prototype demonstration in January 2021. In December 2020, the Space Development Agency selected L3Harris to build and launch four space vehicles to demonstrate the capability to detect and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles.

Disclosures:

The Schwab Ariel ESG ETF is different from traditional ETFs.

Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. This fund will not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example: 


   -- You may have to pay more money to trade the fund's shares. This fund will 
      provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades 
      when they have less information. 
 
   -- The price you pay to buy fund shares on an exchange may not match the 
      value of the fund's portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. 
      These price differences may be greater for this fund compared to other 
      ETFs because it provides less information totraders. 
 
   -- These additional risks may be even greater in bad or uncertain market 
      conditions. 
 
   -- The ETF will publish on its website each day a ""Proxy Portfolio"" designed 
      to help trading in shares of the ETF. While the Proxy Portfolio includes 
      some of the ETF's holdings, it is not the ETF's actual portfolio. 

The differences between this fund and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the fund secret, this fund may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the fund's performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the fund's investment strategy, however, this may hurt the fund's performance.

For additional information regarding the unique attributes and risks of the fund, see Proxy Portfolio Risk, Premium/Discount Risk, Trading Halt Risk, Authorized Participant Concentration Risk, Tracking Error Risk and Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV in the Principal Risks and Proxy Portfolio and Proxy Overlap sections of the prospectus and/or the Statement of Additional Information.

Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, or if available, the summary prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You can obtain a prospectus, or if available, a summary prospectus by visiting schwabassetmanagement.com/schwabetfs_prospectus. Please read it carefully before investing.

All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year end. There is no guarantee that capital gains distributions will not be made in the future. Trading shares of the Funds may also generate tax consequences and transaction expenses. This material is not intended to be tax advice. The tax consequences vary by individual taxpayer. Please consult your tax professional or financial adviser for more information with regard to your specific situation.

Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).

Active Semi-Transparent (also known as Non-Transparent) ETF Risk: Active semi-transparent ETFs operate differently from other exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike other ETFs, an active semi-transparent ETF does not publicly disclose its entire portfolio composition each business day, which may affect the price at which shares of the ETF trade in the secondary market. Active semi-transparent ETFs have limited public trading history. There can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop, be maintained or operate as intended. There is a risk that the market price of an active semi-transparent ETF may vary significantly from the ETF's net asset value and that its shares may trade at a wider bid/ask spread and, therefore, cost investors more to trade than shares of other ETFs. These risks are heightened during periods of market disruption or volatility.

Proxy Portfolio Risk: Unlike traditional ETFs, this fund does not disclose its portfolio holdings (Actual Portfolio) daily. The fund instead posts a Proxy Portfolio on its website each day. The Proxy Portfolio is designed to reflect the economic exposures and risk characteristics of the fund's actual holdings on each trading day, but it is not the same as the fund's Actual Portfolio. Although the Proxy Portfolio is intended to provide investors with enough information to allow for an effective arbitrage mechanism that will keep the market price of the Fund at or close to the underlying NAV per Share of the Fund, there is a risk (which may increase during periods of market disruption or volatility) that market prices will vary significantly from the underlying NAV of the fund. ETF trading on the basis of a published Proxy Portfolio may trade at a wider bid/ask spread than ETFs that publish their portfolios on a daily basis, especially during periods of market disruption or volatility, and therefore may cost investors more to trade. Also, while the Fund seeks to benefit from keeping its portfolio information secret, market participants may attempt to use the Proxy Portfolio to identify a Fund's trading strategy, which if successful, could result in such market participants engaging in certain predatory trading practices that may have the potential to harm the Fund and its shareholders.

Proxy Portfolio Construction -- The Proxy Portfolio is designed to recreate the daily performance of the Actual Portfolio. This is achieved by performing a ""Factor Model"" analysis of the Actual Portfolio. The Factor Model is comprised of three sets of factors or analytical metrics: market-based factors, fundamental factors, and industry/sector factors. The fund uses a ""Model Universe"" to generate its Proxy Portfolio. The Model Universe is comprised of securities that the fund can purchase and will be a financial index or stated portfolio of securities from which fund investments will be selected. The results of the Factor Model analysis are then applied to the Model Universe. The Proxy Portfolio is then generated as a result of this Model Universe analysis with the Proxy Portfolio being a small sub-set of the Model Universe. The Factor Model is applied to both the Actual Portfolio and the Model Universe to construct the fund's Proxy Portfolio that performs in a manner substantially identical to the performance of its Actual Portfolio.

The Proxy Portfolio will only include investments the fund is permitted to hold. The fund's SAI contains more information on the Proxy Portfolio and its construction. Proxy Portfolio and Proxy Overlap Information regarding the contents of the Proxy Portfolio, and the percentage weight overlap between the holdings of the Proxy Portfolio and a Fund's Actual Portfolio holdings that formed the basis for its calculation of NAV at the end of the prior Business Day (the Portfolio Overlap), is available by visiting the fund's website www.schwabassetmanagement.com

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 20, 2021-- 

Pfizer Inc . (NYSE: PFE) announced today the publication of a post-hoc, interim analysis showing that treatment with VYNDAQEL(R) (tafamidis meglumine) / VYNDAMAX(R) (tafamidis) provided a clinically significant survival benefit at five years for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). This analysis from the Phase 3 Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT) and its long-term extension (LTE) study was published in Circulation: Heart Failure.

In ATTR-ACT, patients were randomized to receive VYNDAQEL 80 mg, 20 mg or placebo, and upon study completion at 30 months could enroll in the LTE study. In the LTE study, patients who had been treated with VYNDAQEL 80 mg continued this therapy, then transitioned to the bioequivalent single-capsule VYNDAMAX. Patients treated with placebo in ATTR-ACT were randomized to receive either VYNDAQEL 80 mg or 20 mg in the LTE study and were subsequently transitioned to VYNDAMAX. VYNDAMAX 61 mg is bioequivalent to VYNDAQEL 80 mg but is not interchangeable on a per-mg basis.

""The results from this analysis build upon the positive primary results from the pivotal trial, ATTR-ACT, and reinforce that VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX have the potential to significantly extend survival for patients with ATTR-CM,"" said Brenda Cooperstone, M.D ., Chief Development Officer, Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX represent a breakthrough for these patients who have no other approved medicines and the ATTR-ACT and the LTE study demonstrate that earlier treatment is crucial for patients with ATTR-CM.""

In ATTR-ACT, treatment with VYNDAQEL demonstrated a 30% reduction in mortality at 30 months compared to placebo. With a median follow up of nearly five years, the analysis published in Circulation: Heart Failure showed a clinically significant 41% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality among patients who received continuous VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX treatment (median follow up 58.5 months) compared to patients who first received placebo in ATTR-ACT before transitioning to VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX in the LTE (median follow up 57.1 months; HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.44--0.79; P<0.001). Median survival was 67 months (95% CI: 47.0--N/E) in the continuous treatment arm compared to 35.8 months (95% CI: 29.7--41.1) in the placebo to treatment arm. The preliminary five-year survival rate was 53.2% in the continuous treatment arm versus 32.4% in the placebo to treatment arm.

""The survival benefit seen in the primary analysis is further supported by these long-term results, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment with VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX for patients living with ATTR-CM,"" said Perry Elliott, M.D., Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, Director of the Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London and lead author of the analysis. ""While there has been progress in the diagnosis of ATTR-CM due to increased awareness and improvements in diagnostic approaches, the condition is still overlooked, preventing patients from benefiting from disease modifying treatment.""

Reduction in mortality was consistent across all sub-groups, including wild-type and hereditary ATTR-CM with a 39% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with wild-type ATTR-CM (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.43--0.87; P=0.006), and a 43% reduction in patients with hereditary ATTR-CM (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.33--0.99; P=0.05) in patients receiving continuous VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX treatment, compared with the placebo to treatment arm. In addition, the analysis demonstrated a 44% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with baseline NYHA class I or II (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38--0.82; P=0.003), and a 35% reduction in patients with baseline NYHA class III (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.41--1.01; P=0.06) in the continuous treatment arm compared with the placebo to treatment arm. In ATTR-ACT, VYNDAQEL had a safety profile comparable to placebo. No new safety concerns were identified throughout the LTE study and adverse events remained similar to placebo.

VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are indicated for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. They are the first and only medicines approved for the treatment of wild-type and hereditary ATTR-CM, which is underrecognized and underdiagnosed in patients with heart failure. This rare, progressive and life-threatening disease is caused by unstable transthyretin proteins that misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils that can build up in the heart and other parts of the body. The buildup of transthyretin amyloid in the heart causes the heart muscle to stiffen over time, eventually leading to heart failure. Once diagnosed, the median life expectancy in untreated patients with ATTR-CM is approximately two to 3.5 years.

About ATTR-ACT and the Long-Term Extension

The Phase 3 study, ATTR-ACT, is the first and only completed global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate a pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of ATTR-CM in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM. The primary analysis of the study, which compared a pooled VYNDAQEL (80 mg and 20 mg) treatment group to placebo, demonstrated a significant reduction in the hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations compared to placebo over a 30-month period in patients with wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM (p=0.0006), the study's primary endpoint. Additionally, individual components of the primary analysis demonstrated a relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization of 30% (p=0.026) and 32% (p<0.0001), respectively, with VYNDAQEL versus placebo.

Patients who completed ATTR-ACT were eligible to enroll in the long-term extension (LTE) study for up to 60 months. The LTE is an open-label study that was initially designed to obtain additional safety data for VYNDAQEL 20 mg or 80 mg in subjects diagnosed with ATTR-CM, and to continue to provide patients originally enrolled in ATTR-ACT with VYNDAQEL until local availability. The LTE protocol was amended to transition patients treated with VYNDAQEL 20 mg or 80 mg to single-capsule VYNDAMAX 61 mg. A single VYNDAMAX 61 mg capsule is bioequivalent to VYNDAQEL 80 mg (four 20 mg capsules) and is not interchangeable on a per-mg basis.

About VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX (tafamidis)

VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX (tafamidis) are oral transthyretin stabilizers that selectively bind to transthyretin, stabilizing the tetramer of the transthyretin transport protein and slowing the formation of amyloid that causes ATTR-CM.

VYNDAMAX 61 mg is a once-daily oral capsule developed for patient convenience. A single VYNDAMAX 61 mg capsule is bioequivalent to VYNDAQEL 80 mg (four 20 mg capsules) and is not interchangeable on a per-mg basis.

Tafamidis is approved for the treatment of ATTR-CM over 55 countries including the US, EU, Brazil, UAE and Canada, among others. VYNDAMAX 61 mg and VYNDAQEL 80 mg are the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved doses for the treatment of ATTR-CM.

VYNDAQEL 20 mg was first approved in 2011 in the EU for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), in adult patients with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment. Currently, it is approved for ATTR-PN in over 40 countries, including Japan, countries in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Israel, Russia, and South Korea. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are not approved for ATTR-PN in the US.

VYNDAQEL(R) (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX(R) (tafamidis) From the U.S. Important Safety Information

Adverse Reactions

In studies in patients with ATTR-CM the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with VYNDAQEL was similar to placebo.

Specific Populations

Pregnancy: Based on findings from animal studies, VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of tafamidis in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. Tafamidis is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX.

The deal would facilitate Bank of Montreal's expansion into the U.S., where it has worked to build its presence in recent years. Combined, the banks would have some $870 billion in assets.

Bank of the West operates commercial- and consumer-banking segments, in addition to specialized financing and other services. The San Francisco-based bank has around $89 billion of deposits, assets of about $105 billion and roughly 500 branches in the Midwest and West. It has been owned by France's BNP since 1979.

Bloomberg News reported Thursday that BMO, as Bank of Montreal is known, had held initial talks about buying the BNP unit, which it said could be valued at about $13.7 billion. Bank of Montreal is the fourth-largest bank in Canada.

Its U.S. division delivers about 38% of the bank's revenue, up from about 28% three years ago, Chief Executive Darryl White said on an investor call this month.

Earnings for the bank's U.S. division rose 58% in the fourth quarter, compared with a 42% increase for its Canadian division.

In the U.S., BMO operates commercial, retail, wealth-management and capital-markets businesses.

The bank has said it sees opportunity for growth in its U.S. wealth-management business.

BMO opened its first stateside branch in 1818, about a year after its founding. In the 1990s, it became the first Canadian bank to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The lender has a market value of around $69 billion.

For larger Canadian lenders that want to expand, limited domestic options for growth have prompted them to look across the southern border.

Royal Bank of Canada, the country's second-largest lender, bought Los Angeles-based City National Corp. for $5.4 billion in 2015. Canada's biggest bank, Toronto-Dominion, now operates more branches in the U.S. than in Canada.

European lenders that planted flags in the U.S. starting in the late 1980s have failed to gain much ground. Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC sold out of Citizens Financial Group Inc. in 2015. HSBC Holdings PLC said last year it would close one-third of its U.S. branches.

BBVA of Spain agreed to sell its U.S. arm roughly a year ago to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. for around $11.6 billion in a deal that created the fifth-largest retail bank in the U.S.

While big bank mergers have been rare since the 2008 crisis, there have been more so far this year than any time since then.

But federal financial regulators have expressed interest in tamping down on the spate of mergers. Democratic members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s board have in recent weeks pushed to review regulations around big-bank mergers. Banking-industry officials fear that such a review by the FDIC or other regulators, namely the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, could result in stricter controls on larger deals.

The continued consolidation of financial institutions leaves consumers with fewer banking options and reduces competition, progressive policy makers have argued. Regional banks see joining forces as the best way to fight paltry lending profits and the ever-rising outlays required to keep pace with the technology improvements of the largest banks.",",RY.NO.C:XTSE,RY.PR.P:XTSE,RY.PR.S:XTSE,RY.PR.N:XTSE,RY.PR.T:XTSE,RY.PR.M:XTSE,RY.NO.Q:XTSE,RY.PR.H:XTSE,RYC:XFRA,RY.PR.O:XTSE,RY.PR.Y:XTSE,RY.PR.Z:XTSE,RY.NT.U:XTSE,RY:XNYS,RYpT:XNYS,RBCPF:PSGM,RY.PR.J:XTSE,RY:XSWX,RYN:XMEX,PNCS34:BVMF,PNP:XFRA,PNC:XNYS,0KEF:XLON,PNCFO:PINX,PNCpP:XNYS,PNC:XMEX,PNCF:XWBO,BULZ:XNYS,OILU:ARCX,BNKD:ARCX,OILD:ARCX,BMO.PR.Y:XTSE,FNGO:ARCX,MJJ:ARCX,FNGS:ARCX,BMO.PR.D:XTSE,BMO.PR.F:XTSE,BMO.PR.S:XTSE,NRGD:ARCX,NRGU:ARCX,FNGD:ARCX,0UKH:XLON,BERZ:XNYS,BMQZF:PSGM,BMO.PR.W:XTSE,BMO:XTSE,BMO.PR.E:XTSE,BZZ:XFRA,BMO.PR.B:XTSE,BMON:XMEX,FNGU:ARCX,BNKU:ARCX,BMO.PR.C:XTSE,BMO.PR.T:XTSE,MJO:ARCX,BMO:XNYS,",",tdb,royca,rbsct,pitnat,nyse,hksbc,fdic,ctyn,csbri,bowest,banqnp,banmo,",",banmo,",,",BULZ:XNYS,OILU:ARCX,BNKD:ARCX,OILD:ARCX,BMO.PR.Y:XTSE,FNGO:ARCX,MJJ:ARCX,FNGS:ARCX,BMO.PR.D:XTSE,BMO.PR.F:XTSE,BMO.PR.S:XTSE,NRGD:ARCX,NRGU:ARCX,FNGD:ARCX,0UKH:XLON,BERZ:XNYS,BMQZF:PSGM,BMO.PR.W:XTSE,BMO:XTSE,BMO.PR.E:XTSE,BZZ:XFRA,BMO.PR.B:XTSE,BMON:XMEX,FNGU:ARCX,BNKU:ARCX,BMO.PR.C:XTSE,BMO.PR.T:XTSE,MJO:ARCX,BMO:XNYS,BULZ:XNYS,OILU:ARCX,BNKD:ARCX,OILD:ARCX,BMO.PR.Y:XTSE,FNGO:ARCX,MJJ:ARCX,FNGS:ARCX,BMO.PR.D:XTSE,BMO.PR.F:XTSE,BMO.PR.S:XTSE,NRGD:ARCX,NRGU:ARCX,FNGD:ARCX,0UKH:XLON,BERZ:XNYS,BMQZF:PSGM,BMO.PR.W:XTSE,BMO:XTSE,BMO.PR.E:XTSE,BZZ:XFRA,BMO.PR.B:XTSE,BMON:XMEX,FNGU:ARCX,BNKU:ARCX,BMO.PR.C:XTSE,BMO.PR.T:XTSE,MJO:ARCX,BMO:XNYS,BULZ:XNYS,OILU:ARCX,BNKD:ARCX,OILD:ARCX,BMO.PR.Y:XTSE,FNGO:ARCX,MJJ:ARCX,FNGS:ARCX,BMO.PR.D:XTSE,BMO.PR.F:XTSE,BMO.PR.S:XTSE,NRGD:ARCX,NRGU:ARCX,FNGD:ARCX,0UKH:XLON,BERZ:XNYS,BMQZF:PSGM,BMO.PR.W:XTSE,BMO:XTSE,BMO.PR.E:XTSE,BZZ:XFRA,BMO.PR.B:XTSE,BMON:XMEX,FNGU:ARCX,BNKU:ARCX,BMO.PR.C:XTSE,BMO.PR.T:XTSE,MJO:ARCX,BMO:XNYS,PNCS34:BVMF,PNP:XFRA,PNC:XNYS,0KEF:XLON,PNCFO:PINX,PNCpP:XNYS,PNC:XMEX,PNCF:XWBO,PNCS34:BVMF,PNP:XFRA,PNC:XNYS,0KEF:XLON,PNCFO:PINX,PNCpP:XNYS,PNC:XMEX,PNCF:XWBO,RY.NO.C:XTSE,RY.PR.P:XTSE,RY.PR.S:XTSE,RY.PR.N:XTSE,RY.PR.T:XTSE,RY.PR.M:XTSE,RY.NO.Q:XTSE,RY.PR.H:XTSE,RYC:XFRA,RY.PR.O:XTSE,RY.PR.Y:XTSE,RY.PR.Z:XTSE,RY.NT.U:XTSE,RY:XNYS,RYpT:XNYS,RBCPF:PSGM,RY.PR.J:XTSE,RY:XSWX,RYN:XMEX,RY.NO.C:XTSE,RY.PR.P:XTSE,RY.PR.S:XTSE,RY.PR.N:XTSE,RY.PR.T:XTSE,RY.PR.M:XTSE,RY.NO.Q:XTSE,RY.PR.H:XTSE,RYC:XFRA,RY.PR.O:XTSE,RY.PR.Y:XTSE,RY.PR.Z:XTSE,RY.NT.U:XTSE,RY:XNYS,RYpT:XNYS,RBCPF:PSGM,RY.PR.J:XTSE,RY:XSWX,RYN:XMEX,","Bank of Montreal is in advanced talks to buy BNP Paribas's U.S. unit, Bank of the West, in what would be one of the largest recent bank deals.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 20, 2021-- 

During a time when many Californians are occupied with preparations for the holiday season, there are steps they can take to prevent their distraction from making them an easy target for scammers. While many are aware of the potential for online shopping scams, the same danger exists for utility bill scams, where scammers will demand payment to prevent immediate disconnection.

Every day across the country, electric and natural gas customers, along with telephone, water and other essential services customers, are being targeted by scammers impersonating utilities, typically online, in-person and by telephone. And, the holiday season provides scammers with a prime opportunity to take advantage of customers' distraction and anxiety.

""Scammers are opportunistic and will exploit times when people are busier than normal and potentially stressed, and they do not take the holidays off. Stress and distraction create a window of opportunity where people are also more likely to fall victim to a scam,"" said Ryan Matulka, senior manager, PG&E corporate security. ""Remember, PG&E will not contact you for the first time within one hour of service disconnection, and we will NEVER request payment by a pre-paid debit card or via online payment services like Zelle. If an email, visit to your home or phone call doesn't feel right, don't fall for it. Delete it, shut the door or hang up and call our customer service line or visit our website to confirm your account details.""

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, scammers have increased calls, texts, emails, and in-person tactics and are constantly contacting utility customers asking for immediate payment to avoid service disconnection. Scammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams.

Signs of a potential scam 


   -- Threat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively demand immediate payment 
      for an alleged past due bill. 
 
   -- Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to 
      purchase a prepaid card then call them back supposedly to make a bill 
      payment. 
 
   -- Request for prepaid card: When the customer calls back, the caller asks 
      the customer for the prepaid card's number, which grants the scammer 
      instant access to the card's funds. 
 
   -- Refund or rebate offers: Scammers may say that your utility company 
      overbilled you and owes you a refund, or that you are entitled to a 
      rebate. 

How customers can protect themselves

Customers should never purchase a prepaid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person.

If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill.

Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts.

Scammers Impersonating Trusted Phone Numbers: Scammers are now able to create authentic-looking 800 numbers which appear on your phone display. The numbers don't lead back to PG&E if called back, however, so if you have doubts, hang up and call PG&E at 1-800-743-5000. If customers ever feel that they are in physical danger, they should call 911.

Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with one of these scammers, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission 's website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information.

"Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ",",ccat,nenac,neqac,nfiac,ncat,nfact,",,1639985545000,"""I see an asset that possibly some time in the future could be worth a lot more than what I paid,"" said Mr. Arias, who is 37 years old and helps his father run a small import business in Miami.

Nike, which reports second-quarter earnings Monday, is banking that sneakerheads like Mr. Arias and others will want to invest in virtual kicks as it looks to further expand the digital side of its business by tapping into emerging technologies such as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The tokens are essentially digital deeds that verify the authenticity of the items they represent as unique.

Earlier this month, Nike acquired Rtfkt (pronounced artifact), a startup launched in 2020 that creates NFTs of sneakers and other collectibles, for an undisclosed sum. Nike also recently filed trademark applications indicating it wants to sell NFTs of its sneakers, clothing and other goods stamped with its swoosh logo. Shortly afterward, the company launched a virtual play place on Roblox Corp.'s free online game platform where users can dress their avatars in Nike gear.

The moves speak to Nike's ambitions at a time when a range of fashion and other consumer-goods companies are racing to claim footholds in virtual worlds where people are expected to learn, work, shop and be entertained. Dolce & Gabbana, Jimmy Choo and Adidas AG have launched NFTs. Balenciaga worked with ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games Inc., and Gucci worked with Roblox to create immersive digital worlds.

Nike didn't respond to requests for comment about its plans for Rtfkt. The startup referred questions to Nike.

Nike has long dominated the scarcity model in the physical world by selling limited quantities of exclusive items and hyping their uniqueness, said Erinn Murphy, senior analyst at Piper Sandler & Co. ""There's so much white space for Nike to conquer in the digital realm as well,"" she said.

The apparel-and-sneaker seller has spent years beefing up its digital business by launching apps like SNKRS, which offers users access to exclusive items and events. Analysts say the digital investments have been a boon for sales. Overall, Nike's net sales through its online channels have outpaced sales through bricks-and-mortar stores for more than a year.

Rtfkt, which was valued at $33.3 million after a funding round in May, designs its own virtual sneakers and avatars, which have collectively sold for millions of dollars in just minutes. The company has manufactured physical products through so-called ""forging events,"" where owners of the studio's NFTs can request to have their virtual sneakers made into real ones.

Nike could also release real-world exclusives with NFTs, and the tokens could be traded via digital marketplaces such as OpenSea.

Tech analysts say NFTs could pose financial risks to buyers because their value is largely based on speculation and thus they tend to be volatile. While NFT creators may tout the unique nature of the tokens, they sometimes create thousands for the same item.

It could take years -- if ever -- for NFTs to become major drivers of Nike's sales. But the company's peers are finding some success in the space. Adidas launched its ""Into the Metaverse"" NFT collection on Friday and made around $23 million.

Analysts polled by FactSet project Nike to have generated $11.25 billion of revenue in the three months ended Nov. 30, which would be roughly flat from the comparable year-ago period. Nike's stock price is up 12% over the past year, compared with a 25% gain in the S&P 500.

Nike, like other retailers that rely on manufacturing plants in Asia, has been hit by supply-chain woes stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic. Second-quarter profit could fall roughly 20% from the year-ago period, based on analysts' projections.

The company said in September that shipments were taking twice as long to arrive in the U.S. but that it had enough inventory for the holidays.

Selling NFTs might be one way for Nike to quickly sidestep the supply crunch.

Justin Bazdarich, a restaurant owner and self-described sneakerhead, said he is excited about Nike's purchase of Rtfkt. Mr. Bazdarich, of Brooklyn, N.Y., owns several NFTs, one of which cost $2,000 and is associated with a rotating virtual shoe that Rtfkt created in partnership with streetwear designer Jeff Staple.

""If a big brand is coming into play like Nike, then they're going to help educate people out there that this is the way of the future and will allow other industries to partake,"" the 44-year-old said.

NEW YORK, Dec. 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- WHY: New York, N.Y., December 19, 2021. Rosen Law Firm , a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of S&P Global Inc . (NYSE: SPGI) resulting from allegations that S&P Global may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.

SO WHAT: If you purchased S&P Global securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2192.html   or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On October 4, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it was expanding its probes into misconduct in the global commodities market by investigating suspected manipulation of energy pricing benchmarks published by London-based Platts, a part of S&P Global. Specifically, U.S. prosecutors are probing suspected manipulative behavior by individual traders when submitting those deal prices to Platts' price assessments for oil and other energy benchmarks.

On this news, S&P Global's stock price fell $12.51, or 2.92%, to close at $415.85 on October 4, 2021.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

But how much difference will it make in reviving the drug prospects? Analysts say the move could help improve patient access at the margins, but that uptake will continue to be gradual because of broader doubts over Aduhelm's effectiveness and safety. Biogen estimates 50,000 patients could start treatment next year, but RBC Capital says ""reaching that level may take more time given perceptions on [the] drug's profile itself."" Oppenheimer 's trading desk says the pricing strategy ""may be seen as too little too late but good to see this shift especially given that the drug's efficacy [is] more than debatable."" Biogen falls 0.8%, compared with a 1.2% decline in the Nasdaq Biotechnology index and a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. (joseph.walker@wsj.com)

0920 ET - Job vacancies in Canada hit another record high in 3Q, Statistics Canada reports. Total job vacancies hit 912,600, roughly 25% higher than the previous quarter. The job-vacancy rate--which measures the number of job openings as a proportion of all occupied jobs and vacant positions--also rose to a record 5.4%. Five sectors account for the bulk of the unoccupied jobs: health care, construction, hospitality, retail and manufacturing. Employment in Canada is above prepandemic levels, and the unemployment rate is edging toward prepandemic lows. The Bank of Canada has cited the strong comeback in labor markets as a reason it has accelerated its timetable for its first rate rise in over 3 years, saying it expects economic slack to be absorbed either in 2Q or 3Q of next year.

0706 ET - GlaxoSmithKline's appointment of former Tesco Chief Executive Dave Lewis as nonexecutive chairman of the new consumer healthcare company due to be created in a planned demerger from GSK in 2022 makes sense, Interactive Investor says. The move could help to ease some of the pressure on the drug company from activist shareholder Elliott Advisors, the trading firm says. ""Lewis's six years at the helm of Tesco and almost three decades at consumer goods group Unilever demonstrate his impressive retail and consumer goods experience, a CV that will go hand-in-hand with the spin-off's own aspirations to grow in terms of direct-to-consumer online sales,"" Interactive Investor Head of Investment Victoria Scholar says. Shares fall 1%. (philip.waller@wsj.com)

0612 ET - EssilorLuxottica 's divestment of some Italian assets doesn't affect its market-leading position in the country, Bryan Garnier's Cedric Rossi says. The Franco-Italian eyewear group is to sell its VistaSi optical chain to Vision Group by the end of the next quarter, as part of divestments required by the European Commission for the company's acquisition of Dutch retailer GrandVision , which will also sell some stores in the country. ""[T]his transaction doesn't call into question EssilorLuxottica 's leading role in the highly-fragmented Italian eyewear market,"" Rossi says, adding that related divestments in Belgium and the Netherlands should follow soon.

2059 ET - Supermax's plan to establish a U.S. manufacturing facility may be risky, as the glove industry is facing an oversupply situation, thanks to rising competition from Chinese manufacturers, MIDF Research says. As the impact of the pandemic seems to be improving, MIDF Research thinks that demand for gloves could continue to ebb. The Malaysian glovemaker expects the manufacturing facility to eventually produce 1.6 billion gloves a month. This increased manufacturing capacity could continue to worsen the oversupply situation and lower average selling prices for rubber gloves, MIDF Research says. The research firm lowers its target price to MYR1.48 from MYR1.67 and maintains a neutral rating. Supermax's shares are trading 4.2% higher at MYR1.48. (yiwei.wong@wsj.com)

1813 ET - Citi has concerns around Healius 's proposed A$301 million acquisition of Agilex Biolabs, which conducts analytical services for the clinical trial market. Healius is paying 20 times 2022 Ebitda to acquire the business, and anticipates getting a low single digit boost to EPS in FY 2023. ""It is not obvious to us that this acquisition is so strategic that it justifies the price,"" says Citi, which is neutral-rated on Healius . It says there's no crossover between the diagnostic pathology market and the clinical trial market. ""We have seen other pathology companies buy CRO-style businesses (most notably Labcorp and Covance) with mixed success,"" Citi says. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

1721 ET - Virtus Health 's decision to terminate a A$45 million deal to buy the Adora Fertility business from Healius is a positive outcome, given the acquisition had become bogged down by regulatory concerns that it could restrict competition, Morgans says. Moving on from the deal allows Virtus ""to continue focusing on its core value proposition of improving IVF outcomes for patients and clinicians, as well as working toward reducing its operating cost base in the medium term,"" Morgans says. It retains an add call on Virtus and A$7.13/share price target. Virtus ended last week at A$6.80. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)

The product launches are the latest in a series of crossover ventures as alcohol and soft-drink companies push into one another’s turf. Shares of Anheuser-Busch rose 2.5% Thursday.

A long-running scandal is no longer on the front burner at McDonald’s. Former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook agreed to return compensation now valued at more than $105 million to resolve a legal dispute related to his dismissal as head of the burger chain, the company said Thursday.

The settlement, which avoids a trial against the former top executive, included an apology from Mr. Easterbook who said he “failed at times to uphold McDonald’s values and fulfill certain of my responsibilities as a leader of the company.” He was dismissed in November 2019 when he acknowledged having a consensual relationship with an unnamed employee, McDonald’s said. Shares of McDonald’s rose 0.4% Thursday.

A big proponent of in-person meetings decided to go virtual at one of its premier annual events. On Wednesday, JPMorgan told participants in approaching San Francisco healthcare conference that the spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 had made gathering in person too risky. The bank had earlier told companies it wasn’t going to allow virtual presentations at the January gathering, and that anyone looking to be a part of the conference—which typically draws thousands of people—would have to attend in person.

The bank’s decision came after several biotechnology companies pulled out of planned in-person appearances. JPMorgan’s shares dropped 0.7% Wednesday.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) clashed on Twitter after the lawmaker called on the billionaire to pay more taxes.

“Let’s change the rigged tax code so The Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else,” Ms. Warren tweeted, referring to Mr. Musk, whom Time magazine named its person of the year this week.

The electric-vehicle chief responded with a string of tweets, saying that he will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. “Don’t spend it all at once…oh wait you did already,” he wrote Tuesday evening. “You remind me of when I was a kid and my friend’s angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason,” Mr. Musk said. Tesla shares rose 1.8% Wednesday.

A prominent voice of caution about electric vehicles is reversing its views. Toyota said Tuesday that it would make 3.5 million EVs a year by 2030 and set a target of selling 4 million annually. Toyota had been the last of the world’s top auto makers to express hesitation about such a transition, and even this week it said many of customers, especially in the U.S. outside the coasts, weren’t yet ready for a battery-powered car and might not be for some time.

By 2030, it said it wants all models in its upscale Lexus brand to be electric in the U.S., China and Europe. This week it showed off more than a dozen of the 30 EV models it intends to have on sale by that year. Shares of Toyota rose 2.7% Tuesday.

A big grocer is bagging some Covid-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees. Kroger told workers it would no longer provide two weeks of paid emergency leave for unvaccinated employees who contract the virus unless local jurisdictions require otherwise, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kroger will also add a $50 monthly surcharge to company health plans for unvaccinated managers and other nonunion employees, according to a memo viewed by the Journal.

Both policies are effective Jan. 1, the memo said. Kroger is one of the biggest employers in the U.S., with almost half a million full-time and part-time employees. Its shares dropped 0.1% Tuesday.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

About Renalytix

7 Dec 2021 07:02 ET 
Press Release: Renalytix Reports Financial -2-

At Renalytix, we are helping lead the charge to introduce simple, more accurate prognosis and effective care management for the estimated 850 million people worldwide with chronic kidney disease. In the United States alone, chronic kidney disease affects close to an estimated 40 million people and is responsible for one of the largest cost drivers in the national medical system. Early identification, prognosis and treatment beginning with primary care physicians is essential if we are to stem the growing social cost and suffering associated with kidney disease.

With our lead product, KidneyIntelX, our goal is to shift the conversation from kidney disease to kidney health through a more accurate understanding of early-stage risk. With the deployment of KidneyIntelX this year, Renalytix has become global leader in the new field of bioprognosis, a biology-driven approach to risk assessment that relies on integrating information from a simple blood draw and a patient's health record to produce an accurate picture of kidney health. A doctor can use KidneyIntelX results to act on patients at high risk of kidney disease progression or failure at an early stage where active management and therapeutics have the best opportunity to impact outcomes and cost before it is too late.

We have crossed key data, reimbursement and regulatory hurdles during a relatively short time-period since we opened our doors in 2018 through a public listing on AIM, a market of the London Stock Exchange . We subsequently expanded our capital base by raising a further $17 million in July 2019 and then an additional $85 million through a listing on the Nasdaq Global Market in July 2020. The commercial roll-out of our kidney health solution, KidneyIntelX, is underscored by: 


   -- A 10-year government-wide contract with the U.S. General Services 
      Administration  at $950 per test 
 
   -- Hiring of sales, medical science liaison, and customer service support 
      for national coverage 
 
   -- The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  awarding a national price of 
      $950 per test 
 
   -- 27 state Medicaid program authorization contracts 
 
   -- Partnerships announced with the Mount Sinai Health System, University of 
      Utah , Atrium Health, Wake Forest Baptist Health, and Capital District 
      Physicians' Health Plan  (CDPHP) 
 
   -- New York State Department of Health  approval 
 
   -- A distinct Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) Code for reimbursement 
      granted by the American Medical Association  
 
   -- 20 private payor coverage determinations 
 
   -- Multi-center, peer reviewed clinical studies that found KidneyIntelX is 
      72% more effective than the current standard of care in identifying 
      early-stage patients at high risk for kidney disease progression and 
      failure 

About KidneyIntelX

Our novel platform, KidneyIntelX, uses a machine-learning enabled algorithm to process predictive blood biomarkers with key features from a patient's health record to generate an early and accurate kidney health risk score. The score identifies those patients at the most risk for kidney disease progression and/or failure and further guides ongoing clinical decisions.

KidneyIntelX is initially indicated for use with adults who have diagnosed kidney disease and diabetes -- diabetic kidney disease or DKD. Future KidneyIntelX products in development intend to expand the indicated uses to include broader chronic kidney disease, health equity strategies and kidney health monitoring through treatment. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease, representing nearly 40%, and DKD patients are the highest contributors to emergency room dialysis. Unfortunately, many DKD patients are unaware that they either have kidney disease or that their disease has been progressing, often uncontrolled, for many years and now find themselves making difficult decisions about late-stage treatments. We believe this predicament is largely avoidable and have built the KidneyIntelX care model to ultimately provide the estimated 210,000 primary care physicians in the United States with a comprehensive suite of information and guidelines driven follow-on action.

KidneyIntelX was designed as an expandable platform which is able to add indicated uses and a monitoring capability, all within an FDA regulated framework. Expansion may include extending into additional populations of chronic kidney disease patients beyond those with diabetes, including patients of African ancestry with the APOL1 high-risk genotype. We also intend to develop solutions for use in other large chronic disease patient populations, like cardiovascular disease.

Operational Progress

In November 2021, Renalytix announced a partnership with St. Joseph's Health to implement an advanced clinical care model designed to improve kidney health in patients with type 2 diabetes and early-stage chronic kidney disease. The Renalytix KidneyIntelX platform will be integrated with St. Joseph's Health care management to help prevent patients with diabetes and early-stage kidney disease from unnecessarily progressing to significant disease and/or kidney failure. KidneyIntelX is designed to enable primary care and specialist physicians to easily understand risk and implement St. Joseph's Health medication management, nutrition and education intervention protocols on a timely basis. St. Joseph's Health, based in Syracuse, NY, is part of Trinity Health , one of the largest multi-institutional Catholic health care delivery systems in the U.S., serving diverse communities that include more than 30 million people across 25 states. KidneyIntelX test risk assessment will be available through St. Joseph's Hospital's electronic health record, or her, system, providing access to primary care physicians, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and care teams.

In October 2021, we announced the expansion of our commercial strategy to address early-stage kidney disease in the Veterans Health Administration patient population. KidneyIntelX will be deployed to help VA primary care physicians identify DKD patients at high and low risk for rapid progression and kidney failure. The Veterans Health Administration is America's largest integrated health care system, providing care at 1,293 health care facilities, including 171 medical centers and 1,112 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (VHA outpatient clinics), serving nine million enrolled veterans each year. The veteran population has an approximately one-third higher chronic kidney disease and DKD prevalence than the general population, which has been attributed to the significant multi-morbidity and higher mean age in this group. The prevalence of DKD in veterans is estimated to be between 4% (most conservative DKD definition) and 14%; meaning 0.5 to 1.0 million individuals. We hired Jed Fulk, VP of sales for government accounts, to develop and lead a team of regional sales managers and account executives to support KidneyIntelX(TM) rollout to the VA Health System.

In October 2021, we also disclosed our first Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage contract, as well as coverage with one of New York State's largest not-for-profit health insurance companies with over 1.5 million members

In September 2021, Mount Sinai Health System and Renalytix announced a scale-up of the KidneyIntelX care program to a targeted run-rate of 300 tests per week. Renalytix testing is fully covered at $950 per test under the Mount Sinai real-world evidence program and we expect an estimated 6,000 tests to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022. We expect that previously announced partnerships with Atrium Health, Wake Forest Baptist Health and University of Utah will be running live testing as early as December 2021.

Expert experience is reflected in the design of the KidneyIntelX test report and the newly launched product website -- www.kidneyintelx.com. We believe our education and support program will be an important resource to help inform and improve care for early-stage diabetic kidney disease (""DKD"") patients and support future hospital system deployments of KidneyIntelX in the United States and abroad.

The Company also continues to execute on a number of key operational items including (1) growing our world-class employee base and leadership team to manage U.S. national commercial expansion, (2) developing expanded products which will add to the KidneyIntelX clinical use cases and addressable market, (3) adding laboratory services capacity with our facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, and (4) generating additional utility and validation data to build-out our peer-reviewed performance data dossier.

Reimbursement and Regulatory

We have achieved full insurance coverage for U.S. government physicians ordering KidneyIntelX through our General Services Administration contract and are moving assertively to activate our VA Health System sales strategy. We estimate there is full coverage available at $950 per test to an estimated 400,000 DKD patients in the VA Health System alone.

Under our agreement with the Mount Sinai Health System, we receive payment for KidneyIntelX testing at $950 per reportable result through the first approximately 6,000 patients tested under a real-world evidence development program. In October 2021, this program was expanded system-wide and Mount Sinai is working to achieve a weekly testing run rate of 300 patients.

As we have previously reported, KidneyIntelX has achieved both a distinct Common Procedural Terminology, or CPT, reimbursement code 0105U and inclusion in the final 2020 Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule by CMS which set a national price for KidneyIntelX at $950 per reportable test result.

Press Release: Renalytix Reports Financial -3-

As has been experienced broadly across the diagnostics industry, KidneyIntelX has had a prolonged review since our De Novo submission in August of 2020 due to FDA staffing challenges and continued prioritization of a significant number of COVID-19 related Emergency Use Authorization submissions. Across a number of applications, the FDA is not currently meeting its 150-day De Novo review goal in MDUFA IV due to ""considerable increases in COVID-19 activities"" and this is not unique to Renalytix. We are committed to working collaboratively and expeditiously with the FDA and continue to provide additional information, clarification and supplemental analyses related to our novel KidneyIntelX design as requested. While we will continue to decline to forecast projecting a definitive timeline for De Novo marketing authorization, we are confident that KidneyIntelX will receive FDA De Novo marketing authorization given interactive dialogue and data requirements to date and that Fiscal 2022 commercial objectives are on track.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Financial review of the three-month period ended September 30, 2021

Our operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2021, was $11.8 million (September 30, 2020: $5.4 million) and the net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2021, was $10.1 million (September 30, 2020: $7.2 million).

Revenue

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized $0.45 million of revenue related to testing under the Mount Sinai clinical utility study and $0.03 million of revenue related to services performed for AstraZeneca . There was no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

Cost of Revenue

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, cost of revenue consisted of $0.2 million primarily attributable to KidneyIntelX testing, including labor and materials costs directly related to revenue generating activities. There was no cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development expenses increased by $2.3 million, from $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increased R&D expense was primarily due to increased professional fees as we continue utilities studies at Mount Sinai as well as began utility studies at Wake Forest and University of Utah .

General and Administrative Costs

General and administrative expenses increased by $4.0 million, from $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 to $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in compensation and related benefits, including share-based payments, due to increased headcount, a $0.5 million increase in consulting and professional fees, a $0.4 million increase in marketing expense, a $0.4 million increase in computers, software and IT costs, a $0.2 million increase in insurance expense, and a $0.2 million increase in other operating expenses.

Performance of Contract Liability to Affiliate

In May 2020, we and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai entered into an operating agreement to form a joint venture, Kantaro Biosciences LLC, or Kantaro, for the purpose of developing and commercializing laboratory tests for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 originally developed by Mount Sinai. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized $0.1 million related to the performance of our contract liability with Kantaro compared to $0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020. This represents the allocation of costs related to performing services on behalf of Kantaro.

Foreign Currency Gain (Loss)

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million primarily attributable to intercompany loans and cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We recognized a realized foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and had an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.2 million.

Fair Value Adjustments to VericiDx Investment

We account for our investment in VericiDx using the equity method of accounting and have elected to use the fair value option to value the investment. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a loss of $0.6 million to adjust the VericiDx investment to fair value. There was no fair value adjustment for the three months ended September 31, 2020.

Cash Flows

Net cash used in operating activities

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $10.5 million and was primarily attributable to our $10.1 million net loss including $0.3 million in noncash charges and a $0.1 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $10.4 million and was primarily attributable to our $7.6 million net loss and $3.6 million in the net change in our operating assets and liabilities that was offset by $0.8 million in noncash charges. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $3.8 million decrease in our prepaid expenses and other current assets. Noncash charges were primarily related to share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.

Net cash used in investing activities

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million, primarily attributable to a $0.2 million for purchases of lab and office equipment.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $0.4 million and primarily attributable to $1.0 million in proceeds in short term investments, partially offset by $0.5 million for the purchase of lab and office equipment and $0.1 million of software development costs.

Net cash used in financing activities

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.2 million and was primarily attributable to $0.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock purchase program as well as $0.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $76.9 million and was primarily attributable to $79.2 million of proceeds from our initial public offering on the Nasdaq Global Market which was offset by offering costs of $2.3 million associated with the IPO that were paid in the period.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We had cash and, cash equivalents of $54.3 million as of September 30, 2021, decreased from $65.2 million as of June 30, 2021 due to normal operations as we continue to commercialize KidneyIntelX and grow our business.

RENALYTIX PLC

NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and risks

Renalytix and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Renalytix AI, Inc . and Renalytix AI Limited , (collectively, ""Renalytix"", or the ""Company"") is an artificial intelligence-enabled in vitro diagnostics company, focused on optimizing clinical management of kidney disease to drive improved patient outcomes and significantly lower healthcare costs. KidneyIntelX, the Company's first-in-class diagnostic platform, employs a proprietary artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm that combines diverse data inputs, including validated blood-based biomarkers, inherited genetics and personalized patient data from EHR systems, to generate a unique patient risk score. Additionally, the Company has successfully completed the first stage of a statement of work with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP (""AstraZeneca "") to conduct a feasibility study to determine the impact of the use of the Company's KidneyIntelX platform to optimize utilization of various CKD agents. Further, in December 2020 the Company entered into a master service agreement with AstraZeneca for future services of this nature. As a result of the initial success with AstraZeneca , the Company plans to pursue further collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and make 'Pharmaceutical Services Revenue' a core part of the business going forward with the goal of improving guideline-based standard-of-care for optimal utilization of existing and novel therapeutics using the KidneyIntelX testing platform and proprietary care management software.

Since inception in March 2018, the Company has focused primarily on organizing and staffing the Company, raising capital, developing the KidneyIntelX platform, conducting clinical validation studies for KidneyIntelX, establishing and protecting its intellectual property portfolio and commercial laboratory operations, pursuing regulatory clearance and developing a reimbursement strategy. The Company has funded its operations primarily through equity financings.

The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the diagnostics industry, including, but not limited to, ability to secure additional capital to fund operations, compliance with governmental regulations, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel and protection of proprietary technology. To achieve widespread usage, KidneyIntelX and additional diagnostic products currently under development will require extensive clinical testing and validation prior to regulatory approval and commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities.

2. Liquidity and Going Concern

The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $97.5 million as of September 30, 2021. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of KidneyIntelX or any future products currently in development. Management believes its cash and cash equivalents of $54.3 million as of September 30, 2021, are sufficient to fund the projected operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. Substantial additional capital will be needed by the Company to fund its operations, expand its commercial activities and develop other potential diagnostic related products.

The Company plans to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into strategic alliances or other arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company's shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be required to delay, curtail or discontinue research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospect.

3. Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") and Accounting Standards Updates (""ASU"") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB "").

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments (which consist primarily of accruals and estimates that impact the financial statements) considered necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2021 and its results of operations for the three months ended September 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2022. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, presented herein, do not contain the required disclosures under U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021.

The Company reclassified certain prior year comparative figures in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to conform to the current year's presentation. This change in presentation did not have an impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results.

Principles of consolidation

7 Dec 2021 07:02 ET 
Press Release: Renalytix Reports Financial -6-

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Renalytix plc , and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Renalytix AI, Inc . and Renalytix AI Limited . All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in which it has significant influence but not a controlling financial interest using the equity method of accounting.

Use of estimates

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, actual results may materially vary from these estimates.

Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Significant areas that require management's estimate include the assumptions used in determining the fair value of share-based awards, recording the prepaid/accrual and associated expense for research and development activities performed for the Company by third parties, determining useful lives of property and equipment and capitalized software, the assessment of noncontrolling interest and equity method investments, fair value measurements (including those related to VericiDx), and the consolidation and deconsolidation of variable interest entities.

Segment information

The Company manages its operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company's singular focus is to make significant improvements in kidney disease diagnosis and prognosis, clinical care, patient stratification for drug clinical trials, and drug target discovery.

Foreign currency

The Company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the Company. The functional currency of Renalytix plc and Renalytix AI Limited is GB Pounds. The functional currency of Renalytix AI, Inc . is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities of Renalytix plc and Renalytix AI Limited are translated at the rate of exchange at period-end, while the statements of operations are translated at the weighted average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in income in the period in which the change occurs and reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Concentrations of credit risk and major customers

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable balances. Periodically, the Company maintains deposits in accredited financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company deposits its cash in financial institutions that it believes have high credit quality and are not exposed to any unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships and has not experienced any losses on such accounts.

The Company's accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S. All of the Company's revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was generated from two customers. The Company performs initial and ongoing credit reviews on customers, which involve consideration of the customers' financial information, their location, and other factors to assess the customers' ability to pay.

Fair value of financial instruments

At September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, the Company's financial instruments included accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.

Fair value option

Under the Fair Value Option Subsections of ASC subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments -- Overall, the Company has the irrevocable option to report most financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair value reported in earnings (see Note 5).

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $54.3 million. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $65.1 million.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and are non-interest bearing. The Company considers receivables past due based on the contractual payment terms. The Company reserves specific receivables if collectability is no longer reasonably assured. Estimates for allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on existing contractual obligations, historical payment patterns, and individual customer circumstances. No reserves have been recorded as of September 30, 2021 or June 30, 2021.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.

Performance of contract liability to affiliate

In May 2020, the Company and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai entered into an operating agreement (""Kantaro Operating Agreement"") to form a joint venture, Kantaro Biosciences LLC (""Kantaro""), for the purpose of developing and commercializing laboratory tests for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 originally developed by Mount Sinai. Kantaro has partnered with Bio-Techne Corporation to develop and launch the new test which are designed for use in any authorized clinical testing laboratory without the need for proprietary equipment. During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to the performance of the contract liability with Kantaro. This represents the allocation of costs for performing services on behalf of Kantaro.

Equity method investments

The Company accounts for equity investments where it owns a non-controlling interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence, under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the original cost of the investment is adjusted for the Company's share of equity in the earnings of the equity investee and reduced by dividends and distributions of capital received, unless the fair value option is elected, in which case the investment balance is marked to fair value each reporting period and the impact of changes in fair value of the equity investment are reported in earnings.

Kantaro Biosciences LLC

As the Company can exert significant influence over, but does not control, Kantaro's operations through voting rights or representation on Kantaro's board of directors, the Company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The Company records its share in Kantaro's earnings and losses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company assesses its investment for other-than-temporary impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable and recognize an impairment loss to adjust the investment to its then-current fair value. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the company concluded that the fair value of its equity method investment in Kantaro was zero and recorded a $1.9 million impairment charge. The Company owned 25% of the membership equity units in Kantaro at September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021.

VericiDx Limited

As the Company can exert significant influence over, but does not control, VericiDx's operations through representation on VericiDx's board of directors, the Company accounts for this investment as an equity method investment and has elected the fair value option because VericiDx's stock price is readily observable via the London Stock Exchange . Under the fair value option, the investment in VericiDx is recorded at fair value at each reporting period with subsequent changes in fair value reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Based on closing stock price of VericiDx, the fair value of the investment in VericiDx was $8.5 million at September 30, 2021 and $9.3 million at June 30, 2021. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment of $0.6 million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company owned 6.9% of the ordinary shares of VericiDx at September 30, 2021 and 6.9% at June 30, 2021.

Impairment assessment

7 Dec 2021 07:02 ET 
Press Release: Renalytix Reports Financial -7-

The Company evaluates its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis (see Note 5). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which an investment's fair value has been below its cost; (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) the length of time to maturity; (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (v) the Company's intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value; and (vii) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable.

Software development costs

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 985, Software, which requires software development costs for software to be marketed externally to be expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the software is available for general release and amortized over its estimated useful life of ten years. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model that has been validated.

Revenue recognition

The Company accounts for revenue under ASC 606 --Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""ASC 606""). Pursuant to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.

The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services that it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. Certain contracts have options for the customer to acquire additional services. The Company evaluates these options to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon the renewal option approach. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. The Company uses present right to payment and customer acceptance as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer occurs at a point in time. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue consists of costs directly attributable to the services rendered, including labor costs directly related to revenue generating activities.

Research and development expenses

Research and development costs consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of KidneyIntelX and other studies for KidneyIntelX to determine clinical value and performance in different CKD populations. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Share-based compensation

The Company measures equity classified share-based awards granted to employees and nonemployees based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the respective award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. For share-based awards with service-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company's expected dividend yield. The Company was a privately-held organization prior to November 2018 and has been a publicly-traded company for a limited period of time and therefore lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its shares. Therefore, it estimates its expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly-traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. The expected term of the Company's stock options has been determined utilizing the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is none based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on ordinary shares and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

The Company classifies share-based compensation expense in its condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are classified.

Comprehensive loss

Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in shareholders' equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with shareholders. For the periods presented the only other changes in shareholders' equity is from foreign currency translation.

Net loss per ordinary share

Basic net loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net loss per ordinary share includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or conversion of securities, such as options which would result in the issuance of incremental ordinary shares. Potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as they would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, the weighted average number of shares used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share are the same.

As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were 4,155,125 and 3,408,858 shares, respectively, issuable upon exercise of outstanding options that were anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Emerging growth company

The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the ""JOBS Act""). Under the JOBS Act, companies have extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to avail itself of this exemption and, therefore, while the Company is an emerging growth company it will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public emerging growth companies that have not elected to avail themselves of this exemption.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by, among other provisions, recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. In transition, entities may also elect a package of practical expedients that must be applied in its entirety to all leases commencing before the adoption date, unless the lease is modified, and permits entities to not reassess (a) the existence of a lease, (b) the lease classification or (c) the determination of initial direct costs, as of the adoption date, which effectively allows entities to carryforward accounting conclusions under previous U.S. GAAP. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which provides entities an optional transition method to apply the guidance under Topic 842 as of the adoption date, rather than as of the earliest period presented. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No 2020-05 that further delayed the effective date of Topic 842 to fiscal years beginning July 1, 2022, and interim periods within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance to its consolidated financial statements.

Press Release: Renalytix Reports Financial -8-

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This is different from the current guidance as this will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. The new guidance will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance to its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which, generally, provides guidance for investments in entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ASU 2020-01 is effective for all entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance to its consolidated financial statements.

4. Revenue

Testing services revenue

Testing services revenue is generated from the KidneyIntelX platform, which provides analytical services to customers. Each individual test is a performance obligation that is satisfied at a point in time upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) which is when control passes to the customer and revenue is recognized. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized $0.4 million of testing services revenue. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. The Company did not recognize any testing services revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020.

Pharmaceutical services revenue

Pharmaceutical services revenue is generated from the provision of analytical services to customers. Contracts with customers generally include an initial upfront payment and additional payments upon achieving performance milestones. The Company uses present right to payment and customer acceptance as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer which may occur at a point in time or over time depending on the individual contract terms. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized $32,000 of pharmaceutical services revenue where performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. There was no pharmaceutical services revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2020.

Professional services revenue

Professional services revenue consists of services related to the creation of a branded care navigation portal/pathway for use with KidneyIntelX. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.

The Company did not recognize any professional services revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2021 or 2020.

Deferred revenue

Deferred revenue represents the allocated transaction price to the material right which will be recognized as revenue when the renewal options are exercised which is expected to occur over the next 24 months.

The following table summarizes the changes in deferred revenue (in thousands):

5. Fair value measurements and the fair value option

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:

-- Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities)

-- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly

-- Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions

This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 


 
 
                                     Fair value measurement at

--------------------------  ----  ------------  ----  -----  ---  ------ 
 

Non-financial assets and liabilities

The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment and equity method investments, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at carrying value in its consolidated balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable, the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant assumptions.

Based on sales forecasts, the Company concluded that its equity method investment in Kantaro was impaired due to a shift in focus from COVID antibody testing to promoting vaccination in the United States and European Union . As a result of this shift, demand for COVID antibody testing decreased. The forecasts indicate there is a prolonged period of time that Kantaro's fair value will be is below the carrying value of the investment and the discounted and undiscounted cash flows are also below the carrying value of the investment. For these reasons, the Company concluded the decline in value is other-than-temporary. As such, during the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company determined the fair value using a discounted cash flow model and concluded that the fair value of the equity method investment in Kantaro was zero.

9. License and services agreements

Mount Sinai license and sponsored research agreements

On May 30, 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the ""ISMMS License Agreement"") and, on March 7, 2019, a sponsored research agreement (the ""ISMMS SRA"") with Mount Sinai. Under the terms of the ISMMS License Agreement, ISMMS granted the Company (i) an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain patent rights covering specific inventions concerning the utilization of biomarkers guided artificial intelligence techniques for detecting kidney functional decline (the ""ISMMS Technology""), (ii) a non-exclusive license under unregistered licensed copyrights and licensed know-how and (iii) an exclusive option to obtain licensed technology conceived after May 30, 2018. The Company is obligated to pay Mount Sinai $1.5 million and $7.5 million in commercial milestone payments upon achieving worldwide net sales of KidneyIntelX of $50.0 million and $300.0 million, respectively. The Company is also obligated to pay Mount Sinai a 4% to 5% royalty on net sales of KidneyIntelX, subject to customary reductions. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product basis from first commercial sale of such product until the later of (1) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product or (2) on a country-by-country basis, 12 years from first commercial sale of such product in such country. Moreover, the Company is obligated to pay Mount Sinai between 15% and 25% of any consideration received from a sublicensee. Furthermore, the Company agreed to carry out and fund a clinical utility study for KidneyIntelX at an estimated cost of $0.7 million upon approval of the study protocol by the Institutional Review Board.

As part of the ISMMS SRA, the Company has agreed to fund several research projects to further develop the ISMMS Technology. The Company incurred approximately $0.4 million in research and development expenses under the ISMMS SRA for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The Company did not incur any expenses related to the ISMMS SRA for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

Mount Sinai COVID-19 sponsored research agreement

In August, 2020 and as amended in December 2020, the Company entered into a Multi-center Assessment of Survivors for Kidney Disease after COVID-19 Study (the ""MASKeD-COVID Study"") with ISMMS. This study involves multiple major academic institutions, including Mount Sinai, University of Michigan , Johns Hopkins , Yale University and Rutgers University . The goal of this study is to understand the long-term kidney epidemiology of CKD in survivors of COVID-19 and validate KidneyIntelX for prediction of long-term kidney outcomes post-COVID hospitalization that will inform further prevention, treatment and clinical care.

Under the terms of the MASKeD-COVID Study, the Company is obligated to pay for all direct and indirect costs incurred under the sponsored research agreement in an amount totaling $1.8 million. As of September 30, 2021, amounts due to ISMMS under the MASKeD-COVID Study totaled $0.9 million, and $0.5 million was expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The Company did not incur any expenses related to this program during the three months ended September 30, 2020.

Joslin diabetes center license agreement

In October 2018, the Company purchased a worldwide exclusive license agreement (the ""Joslin Agreement"") with the Joslin Diabetes Center, Inc. (""Joslin"") that was previously entered into with EKF Diagnostics Holding Plc (""EKF""), a related party, in July 2017. The license agreement provides the Company with the right to develop and commercialize licensed products covering a novel methodology of diagnosing and predicting kidney disease using certain biomarkers (the ""Joslin Diabetes Technology"").

Under the terms of the Joslin Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Joslin aggregate commercial milestone payments of $0.3 million and $1.0 million in commercial milestone payments upon achieving worldwide net sales of licensed products and processes of $2.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively. The Company is also obligated to pay Joslin a 5% royalty on net sales of any licensed products or licensed processes, subject to customary reductions. Moreover, the Company is obligated to pay Joslin 25% of any consideration received from a sublicensee.

The Joslin Agreement initially expires on July 31, 2025 and is subject to an automatic five-year extension unless either party notifies the other party of its intent not to extend the agreement at least 180 days prior to initial expiration. Either party may terminate the Joslin Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party, the insolvency of the other party, or in the event the other party is unable to perform its obligations under the agreement for a specified period. Additionally, Joslin may terminate the agreement in the event that the Company ceases developing or commercializing licensed products or processes, if the Company fails to maintain certain required insurance policies, and if the Company fails to pay patent expenses related to the licensed patents.

Joslin sponsored research agreement

In September 2021, the Company finalized a sponsored research agreement (the ""Joslin SRA"") with Joslin for patent filings on certain additional novel biomarkers in kidney disease for development and deployment in the KidneyIntelX platform. The novel biomarkers have the potential to provide additional clinical utility for understanding early disease progression and risk of kidney failure, therapeutic response, and the mechanistic pathways of kidney disease beyond the inflammatory and tubular injury markers that are currently captured by KidneyIntelX. The agreement provides for performance of research and development activities up to a total amount of $1.7 million related to completion of the study.

The Company did not incur any expenses related to the Joslin SRA during the three months ended September 30, 2021.

10. Shareholders' equity

Ordinary shares

As of September 30, 2021, the Company had 76,395,831 ordinary shares authorized on a fully diluted basis. Each share entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders.

11. Share-based compensation

Equity Incentive Plan

In November 2018, Company established the Renalytix plc Share Option Plan (the ""Plan"") and a U.S. Sub-Plan and Non-Employee Sub-Plan. The Plan provides for the Company to grant options, restricted share awards and other share-based awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. As of September 30, 2021, there were 3,047,838 shares available for future issuance under the Plan.

The Plan is administered by the board of directors. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions are determined at their discretion, except that all options granted have exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the term of stock option may not be greater than ten years from the grant date.

The options granted as of September 30, 2021 vest equally over twelve quarters following the grant date, with the exception of 80,724 options which vested immediately when granted, 602,100 options which vest 25% on the one year anniversary and equally over twelve quarters following the one year anniversary and 500,000 which vest 1/12th on the one year anniversary and equally over twelve quarters following the one year anniversary. If options remain unexercised after the date one day before the tenth anniversary of grant, the options expire. On termination of employment, any options that remain unexercised are either forfeited immediately or after a delayed expiration period, depending on the circumstances of termination. Upon the exercise of awards, new ordinary shares are issued by the Company.

The Company recorded share-based compensation expense in the following expense categories in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):

The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account inputs such as the exercise price, the value of the underlying ordinary shares at the grant date, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The fair value of each grant of options during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were determined using the methods and assumptions discussed below. 


   -- The expected term of employee options is determined using the 
      ""simplified"" method, as prescribed in SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 
      No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the 
      vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to the 
      Company's lack of sufficient historical data. 
 
   -- The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the 
      publicly-traded common stock of a peer group of companies. 
 
   -- The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate payable on U.S. 
      Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is 
      commensurate with the assumed expected term. 
 
   -- The expected dividend yield is none because the Company has not 
      historically paid and does not expect for the foreseeable future to pay a 
      dividend on its ordinary shares. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the grant date fair value of all option grants was estimated at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions:

Employee Share Purchase Plan

The Company's 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ""ESPP"") became effective on August 17, 2020. The ESPP authorizes the issuance of up to 850,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued pursuant to rights granted under the ESPP shall automatically increase on January 1st of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021 and continuing for ten years, in an amount equal to the lesser of one percent of the total number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and 2,000,000 ordinary shares, subject to the discretion of the board of directors or renumeration committee to determine a lesser number of shares shall be added for such year.

Under the ESPP, eligible employees can purchase the Company's common stock through accumulated payroll deductions at such times as are established by the board of directors or renumeration committee. Eligible employees may purchase the Company's common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the first day of the offering period or on the purchase date. Eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation. Under the ESPP, a participant may not purchase more than $25,000 worth of the Company's common stock for each calendar year in which such rights is outstanding. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, 10,920 shares were purchased under the ESPP.

In accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-50 -- Compensation -- Stock Compensation, the ability to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at 85% of the lower of the price on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the offering period (i.e. the purchase date) represents an option and, therefore, the ESPP is a compensatory plan under this guidance. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is determined based on the option's grant-date fair value as estimated by applying the Black Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized over the withholding period. The Company recognized share-based compensation expense of $23,000 and $10,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the ESPP.

EKF Diagnostic Holdings

Press Release: Renalytix Reports Financial -11-

During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred expenses of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to employees of EKF who provided services to Renalytix and is included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

In May 2018, the Company secured its cornerstone license agreement with ISMMS for research and clinical study work and intended commercialization by the Company (see Note 9). As part of the collaboration, ISMMS became a shareholder in the Company and has subsequently made equity investments both in the Company's IPO on AIM in November 2018, the subsequent sale of ordinary shares in July 2019 and the Company's IPO on Nasdaq in July 2020. As of September 30, 2021, amounts due to ISMMS totaled $1.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company incurred expenses of $1.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which are included in research and development expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Kantaro Biosciences LLC

In connection with the formation of Kantaro, the Company entered into a five-year Advisory Services Agreement (""Advisory Agreement"") pursuant to which the Company has agreed to provide certain advisory services to Kantaro. Pursuant to the Kantaro Operating Agreement, Kantaro issued 750 Class A Units to Mount Sinai in exchange for Mount Sinai granting licenses to Kantaro under certain intellectual property rights of Mount Sinai and 250 Class A Units to the Company as the sole consideration for the services to be rendered by the Company under the Advisory Agreement. A portion of the Company's units are subject to forfeiture if, prior to December 31, 2021, Kantaro terminates the Advisory Agreement as a result of an uncured material breach of the Advisory Agreement or in the event the Company is acquired by a hospital or health system that serves all or any portion of the service areas served by Mount Sinai. The Company determined the fair value of the services to be provided under the Advisory Agreement was $2.0 million and the fair value of the Class A units received from Kantaro was $2.0 million. Fair value was determined using discounted cash flows which is a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. The method requires several judgments and assumptions which include discount rates and future cash flows, among others. As a result of the impairment charge in the year ended June 30, 2021 as discussed in Note 5, the carrying value of the Kantaro investment was written down to zero.

A contributing factor to the impairment consideration for Kantaro was lower forecasted sales volume and consequently, a lower time commitment from Renalytix employees. Based on these circumstances, the Company adjusted the liability to perform services to Kantaro under the Advisory Agreement during the year ended June 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, the total liability associated with the services was $0.3 million, of which the total amount is classified as a current liability.

For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in the statement of operations related to services performed under the Advisory Agreement. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, $33,000 and $28,000 of costs incurred related to the performance of the Advisory Agreement services were included within research and development and general and administrative expense, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, $0.2 million and $0.1 million of costs incurred related to the performance of the Advisory Agreement services were included within research and development and general and administrative expense, respectively.

In addition to the equity granted at formation, the Company and Mount Sinai each committed to making a loan to Kantaro. Mount Sinai committed to lend an initial amount of $0.3 million and an additional $0.5 million thereafter. The Company committed to lend an initial amount of $83,333 and an additional $166,667 thereafter. Each loan bears interest at a per year rate equal to 0.25%, compounded monthly, until repaid, and is repayable from the first amounts that would otherwise constitute cash available for distribution to the members of Kantaro (provided that each loan repayment will be made, 75% to Mount Sinai and 25% to the Company based on each investor's proportionate ownership). The Company loaned Kantaro $250,000 and initially recorded a note receivable. The Company elected to recognize the equity investment losses based on the ownership level of each specific investment and will continue to record equity method losses until the amount of the loan receivable is reduced to zero. The loan had a carrying value of $75,000 at September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021.

VericiDx

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company paid the salary of an executive of VericiDx and VericiDx has agreed to reimburse the Company for those amounts. As of September 30, 2021, amounts due from VericiDx totaled $29,000.

TORONTO, Dec. 7, 2021 /CNW/ - Adventus Mining Corporation (""Adventus"") (TSXV: ADZN) (OTCQX: ADVZF) and Salazar Resources Limited (""Salazar"") (TSXV: SRL) (OTCQB: SRLZF) (collectively the ""Partners"") are pleased to provide an update on exploration activities in Ecuador for the Curipamba, Pijili and Santiago projects. The Partners are currently finalizing drilling plans for 2022.

Highlights 


   -- Curipamba -- at the newly identified Agua Santa volcanogenic massive 
      sulphide system (VMS) within the Curipamba district, CREG-011 intersected 
      3.35 metres of 0.76% copper, 1.39 g/t gold, 4.29% zinc, 12.5 g/t silver, 
      and 0.17% lead -- including 1.40 metres of 1.58% copper, 2.67 g/t gold, 
      31.20% zinc, 55.0 g/t silver, and 1.01% lead 
 
   -- Drilling on the Agua Santa target completed 11 drill holes totaling 2,818 
      metres 
 
   -- Pijili -- the Partners are drill ready on a new porphyry target called El 
      Pato 
 
   -- Santiago -- target generation ahead of the initial minimum 2,500 m drill 
      program is complete, with drilling planned for Q1 2022. The first hole is 
      expected to twin historical Newmont drill hole FUD-001 that intersected 
      323.09 metres, grading 0.23% copper and 0.40 g/t gold (see June 15, 2020 
      news release) and deepen to test the MobileMT geophysical anomaly 

Curipamba Project Update

Regional drilling on the Agua Santa target (Figure 1) started mid-June 2021 and completed on October 3, 2021 with 11 drill holes having been successfully completed totaling 2,818 metres. VMS mineralization was identified in the first drill hole of the work program (CREG-008) designed to test the edge of a Mobile MT (""MMT"") airborne geophysical anomaly (Figure 1) that coincided with both favourable geology and surface geochemistry results from prospecting in nearby creek beds (see August 9, 2021 news release). Drill collar locations are summarized in Table 1 at the end of this news release.

CREG-011 was a step-out drill hole, collared from the same drilling platform as CREG-008 (see Figure 2) designed to undercut the massive sulphide mineralization on the same drill section. It intersected faulted, but fragmental looking massive sulphide mineralization from 40.35 to 43.70 metres grading, 0.76% copper, 1.39 g/t gold, 4.29% zinc, 12.5 g/t silver and 0.17% lead (Table 2). The intercept had a copper-rich top from 40.35 to 40.70 metres grading, 4.76% copper, 0.51 g/t gold, 0.91% zinc, 28.0 g/t silver, and 0.03% lead, and a zinc-rich base from 41.62 to 42.30 metres grading, 0.37% copper, 5.67 g/t gold, 19.92% zinc, 39.3 g/t silver and 0.77% lead (Table 2).

including     41.62  42.30          0.68   0.37     5.67  19.92     39.3   0.77 
 
 
(1)  This is an early-stage exploration project, meaning 
      geological modeling has not determined the orientation 
      of stratigraphy to accurately determine an approximate 
      true thickness for lithologies and mineralization 
 

An interesting feature of CREG-011 is a wide, low-grade, sulphidized section of the host strata in the hanging wall of the faulted massive sulphide mineralization from 29.75 to 40.35 metres grading, 0.10% copper, 0.68 g/t gold, 0.26% zinc, 2.2 g/t silver, and 0.04% lead. This low-grade intercept suggests the hydrothermal system continued to exhaust mineralized fluids after the deposition of the massive sulphide mineralization. Further review is being undertaken to assess possible vectoring using data from adjacent drill holes.

CREG-009 was a step-out drill hole, collared 82 metres to the north-northeast of CREG-008 (see Figure 3) and although it intersected similar volcanic stratigraphy to CREG-008, it appears to have pierced the favourable VMS horizon hosting the massive sulphide mineralization (see August 9, 2021 news release), CREG-009 only intersected highly sulphidized, geochemically anomalous mafic volcaniclastic rocks. The best mineralization intersected in CREG-009 is related to a fault zone from 170.18 to 171.26 metres, grading 1.16% copper, 0.05 g/t gold, 0.01% zinc, and 1.14 g/t silver.

CREG-010 was a step-out drill hole, collared 47 metres to the southwest of CREG-008 (see Figure 4) and although it intersected similar volcanic stratigraphy to CREG-008 and CREG-009, like CREG-009, it appears to have pierced the favourable VMS horizon hosting the massive sulphide mineralization (see August 9, 2021 news release) but only intersected wide, highly sulphidized, geochemically anomalous section of mafic volcaniclastic rocks. Mineralization was intersected from 41.00 to 52.04 metres, grading 0.09% copper, 0.20 g/t gold, 0.25% zinc, and 1.7 g/t silver. A narrow section of higher-grade material occurs from 44.50 to 45.12 metres, grading 0.88% copper, 1.32 g/t gold, 2.26% zinc, 14.8 g/t silver and 0.01% lead.

The Partners continue to wait for analytical results to be completed and released from the laboratory for regional drill holes CREG-012 to CREG-018. It is understood that BV laboratory is experiencing a significant increase in through volume that is resulting in longer than expected delays for its clients to receive geochemical results. These delays are unfortunately hampering assessment and the interpretation of exploration programs including the relationship of any drill hole results to two prospecting showings of bedrock, fault-controlled VMS mineralization at Agua Santa. The laboratory delays are creating a major challenge for consistent exploration news flow. Once data from drilling and surficial geochemical sampling has been returned from the laboratory and passed the Partners' internal QAQC protocols, the results will be disclosed.

Regional drill holes at El Panecillo, east of El Domo (CREG-003, CREG-005, and CREG-006), and at Selva Alegre (CREG-007) did not yield any significant results, although they intersected known strata in the volcanic edifice known to host the El Domo VMS deposit (Figure 1). Further assessment of the geochemistry is ongoing to determine if there are possible exploration vectors present that can be used for follow-up exploration work.

Pijili Project Update

During the second half of 2021, exploration activities continued to follow up on target generation results on the Mercy, Rosa de Oro, and Carmen de Pijili concessions that make up the Pijili project. Field activities included prospecting, geological mapping, hydrothermal alteration studies, and structural mapping that focused on the paragenetic sequencing of the veining and its link to possible epithermal and porphyry systems known to occur regionally.

On the Rosa de Oro and Carmen de Pijili concessions, the technical staff focused their work on the four high-priority targets called El Pato, Rosa de Oro, Naranjos and Papagayo discussed in the April 9, 2021 news release. Table 3 summaries total samples collected to date on Pijili project concessions supporting target generation and drill platform spotting. Copper and gold rock geochemistry is presented in Figures 5 and 6 respectively, and copper and gold soil geochemistry is presented in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. The technical team has concluded that El Pato is ready for final drill targeting, as it is the highest-ranking target on these two western concessions for Pijili project. The Partners have scouted drill platform locations for the El Pato target while planning and budgeting is being conducted for potential drilling in the first half of 2022.

Work at the Mercy concession finished in June 2021 with the completion of sampling over the newly discovered Ensillada porphyry system (see April 20, 2021 news release). Sampling included a detailed review of a newly established section of gravel road constructed through the Ensillada porphyry system by a local artisanal miner to access their property. All work since the completion of drilling and the discovery of the Ensillada porphyry system has confirmed the presence of a large hydrothermal system that remains open to the north, northeast and east. Copper and gold rock geochemistry is presented in Figures 9 and 10 respectively, and copper and gold soil geochemistry is presented in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. The technical team continues to review results to plan a follow-up exploration budget for 2022.

Press Release: Adventus And Salazar Provide an -2-

Technical crews have finished prospecting and geological mapping the entire Santiago concession, producing the first unified geological and hydrothermal alteration map (Figures 13 and 14). The target generation work has collected 1,053 rock samples bringing the total number of samples to 1,148 between 2017 and 2021. This is in addition to the 760 historical rock samples collected by Silex Ecuador S.A. (see June 2020 news release). Once data from the rock sampling has been returned from the laboratory and passed the Partners' internal QAQC protocols, the results will be disclosed.

The principal target area at Santiago has coincident favourable geological and hydrothermal alteration suggesting a high-sulphidation porphyry system denoted by extensive quartz-alunite alteration, coincident historical geochemical anomalies for copper and gold over 2,200 metres by 600 metres, and a geophysical airborne MobileMT signature with both a low frequency apparent conductivity geophysical and resistivity anomaly of approximately 3,000 by 2,000 metres and TMI-RTP magnetic low of approximately 2,000 by 1,500 metres that is encircled by areas of higher magnetic response (see June 15, 2020 news release). The magnetic low is suggestive of magnetic mineral destruction from hydrothermal alteration.

This principal target is also coincident with historical drilling by Prospection and Newmont; however, a 3D review indicates that due to the short drill hole lengths of that era, these two historical drilling programs do not provide an explanation for the large MobileMT geophysical anomaly, which suggests that additional, deeper drilling is warranted. The Partners plan on twinning FUD-001 (Newmont drill hole) in Q1 2022, as part of a 2,500-metre drilling program. This program was delayed to accommodate additional community relations and social work with stakeholders that includes but is not limited to the Ecuadorian government and Indigenous leadership. Twinning Newmont's FUD-001 drill hole is critical in not only validating their historical intersection of 323.09 metres, grading 0.23% copper and 0.40 g/t gold, but also examining the deeper MobileMT anomalies (see June 15, 2020 news release).

Technical Information and QAQC

The three Ecuadorean exploration projects (Curipamba, Pijili, and Santiago) are being managed and reviewed by Vice President Exploration, Jason Dunning, M.Sc ., P.Geo., a Qualified Person within the meaning of NI 43-101. Salazar staff collect and process samples that are securely sealed and shipped to Bureau Veritas (""BV"") in Quito for sample preparation that includes crushing and milling to prepare pulps that are then split for shipment to their facility in Vancouver, Canada for analysis. All assay data have undergone internal validation of QAQC; noting there is an established sampling control program with blind insertion of assay blanks, certified industry standards and sample duplicates for the Curipamba project. A QAQC program is also in place at BV and includes insertion of blanks, standards, and duplicate reanalysis of selected samples. BV's quality system complies with the requirements for the International Standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025: 1999. At BV, samples from regional drilling have silver and base metals analyzed by a modified ore grade 34-element aqua regia technique with ICP-ES finish. Gold is analyzed by fire assay fusion with AAS finish. Overlimit protocols are in place for gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc.

""It is not that we have done anything outlandish, but I continue to believe there is a good possibility that we could see prices work generally lower into Christmas and the end of the year,"" says Hueber. Shorter-term, traders appear to be getting positions ready ahead of Thursday's WASDE report from the USDA --but for the remaining weeks of the year, a holiday ramp-down is on traders' minds. CBOT corn futures are down 0.3% currently, while soybeans are off 0.7% and wheat loses 0.5%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

1103 ET - Brazil's exports of chicken declined in November from a year earlier but are likely to reach a record for the year, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein , or ABPA. Total chicken exports fell 4.5% last month from a year earlier, to 334,700 metric tons, according to the group. Revenue from exports in November jumped 27% from a year earlier to $605.3M. Exports reached 4.2M tons in the first 11 months of 2021, an increase of 9.1% compared with the same period a year earlier. Export revenue rose 25% in that period to $6.9B from a year earlier. Brazil has been exporting more processed chicken this year, boosting the value of the sales abroad, ABPA markets director Luis Rua says. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

1046 ET - Livestock futures trading on the CME decline, with live-cattle futures down 0.5% and lean-hog futures off 2.1%. For cattle, the downward slide seen so far has much more distance to travel, AgResource says. ""By all historical/fundamental measures, CME cattle futures are far overvalued,"" the firm says. ""US economic conditions are unprecedented, yet retail beef prices continue to push to record levels."" At their current levels, cattle futures are trading at their highest levels since 2017. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

1042 ET - US benchmark oil prices are adding to earlier gains, with WTI crude up 3.6% at $72.01 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent is 3.1% higher at $75.35. ""Prices continue to turn higher through early trading this week, with both benchmarks now returning above the $70/bbl level,"" Schneider Electric 's Robbie Fraser says. ""With inventory numbers due mid-week, the market seems to have found some support in the meantime on speculation that COVID's Omicron variant could have a more mild impact than initially feared."" (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0945 ET - Grain traders are paying attention for any news that comes out of talks between President Biden and Russian President Putin today, says Terry Reilly of Futures International. The talks come as Russia amasses troops at the Russia-Ukraine border. For wheat in particular, the implications of this situation turning hot could be immediate--with Russia and Ukraine both being leading sources for wheat exports. Wheat futures on the CBOT are down 0.6% in pre-market trading Tuesday. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

0912 ET - Grain futures are slightly lower pre-market, despite strength seen in crude oil and other assets this morning. Tomm Pfitzenmaier of Summit Commodity Brokerage says we may be ""seeing the beginning of trade positioning ahead of Thursday's WASDE report."" Analysts surveyed by WSJ are forecasting growth in soybean and wheat stocks in the WASDE. Corn futures are down 0.5% this morning, while soybeans slip 0.2% and wheat is off 0.6%.

0836 ET - Natural gas prices are trying to regain their footing after falling nearly 12% yesterday to their lowest price since mid July. The front-month gas contract for January delivery trades 0.9% higher at $3.692/mmBtu. The collapse in prices has been ongoing, with prices seeing a 33% drop from just 30 days ago, fueled by very mild temperatures that are allowing homes and businesses to keep their heaters turned off. Those mild temperatures have reduced gas demand and have also erased bullish fears of winter shortages. Today's uptick in prices may mean a floor to the sell-off has been reached, although prices remain 43% higher from this date last year. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0818 ET - Oil prices continue a sharp rebound from 15-week-lows reached last week as investors decide the fears over Covid's omicron variant were way overdone. WTI crude trades 2.8% higher at $71.41 a barrel, while Brent crude also gains more than 2% to nearly $75. ""It appears the major oil price selloff is over as the mid-$60s has provided strong support and has been accompanied with a steady reminder that the oil market will remain vulnerable to some shortfalls over the next couple of years,"" says Oanda's Edward Moya . Investors will next watch for weekly US inventory data from trade group API, due at 4:30 pm ET this afternoon. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)

0559 ET - Speculative financial investors don't seem to have returned to the gold market yet in spite of bond yields falling and stock-market corrections, Commerzbank says. Recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows net long positions at a four-week low in the week to Nov. 30. ""For as long as gold lacks the support of financial investors, it will probably find it difficult in our opinion to regain the technically important 100- and 200-day moving averages at a good $1,790 or the psychologically important $1,800 mark,"" the bank says. Comex gold futures tick slightly higher to $1,780.57 a troy ounce. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)

0539 ET - Palm oil prices closed higher in Asian trading after Indonesia unveiled plans today for a new levy within two years on palm plantations to raise funds for environmental sustainability purposes, said a Kuala Lumpur-based crude palm oil futures broker. Although the levy may only materialize in two years, the market reacted in advance as the additional levy could increase the cost of importing the edible oil from Indonesia, he said. The benchmark CPO contract for February delivery closed MYR181 higher at MYR4,931 a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange. (chester.tay@wsj.com)

0538 ET - Copper prices are steady as China's central bank moves to stimulate its slowing economy amidst concerns of a property market slump. Beijing said it would reduce the amount of money banks are required to set aside starting in mid-December, a move that would inject liquidity into the country's financial system. Meanwhile, China's copper imports last month reached their highest level since March, tallying with the picture of a stabilizing economy, according to analysts at Commerzbank .

1203 ET - Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has set a date for a long-awaited strategic presentation that aims to give investors a comprehensive overview of where the newly merged company is headed. Tavares says the company plans to hold the event March 1. Executives are expected to detail the company's turnaround plans in China and offer more specifics on the promised synergies of the merger, which Stellantis has said could produce some $6B in annual cost savings. Stellantis gains 3.6% to $16.87 amid a market rally. (nora.naughton@wsj.com)

1104 ET - Comcast ""will set a record"" for mobile net additions during 4Q, as the cable giant has been pushing to grow its wireless business with competitive pricing compared to traditional wireless peers. This means there will be more mobile customer net additions in 4Q21 than 3Q21, Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson says at the UBS Investor Conference. Comcast 's 3Q21 had been a record quarter for mobile, as the company added 285,000, the most since it was launched in 2017. In total, Comcast had nearly 3.7M wireless lines as of late September. Comcast relies on Verizon 's wireless network when providing its service, but Watson says the company has recently been doing tests on its acquired spectrum. (lillian.rizzo@wsj.com; @lilliannnn)

1052 ET - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says Mobileye will be IPOed with a healthy balance sheet, but that most of the cash from the transaction will flow to Intel .

1046 ET - Miami-based investment firm 777 Partners' addition of an order for 30 more Boeing 737 MAX jets takes its total to 68 planes so far this year. Remarkably, eight have already been delivered, even though the first deal only came in March. The new batch includes the largest 737-8-200 model used by Ryanair , with 777 Partners already providing jets for Canada's Flair and existing and planned low cost carriers in Asia, including Australian start-up Bonza. The firm's other interests include European soccer clubs, insurance operations and consumer lending. (doug.cameron@wsj.com)

1029 ET - The videogame industry's biggest publishers are having a ho-hum start to the holiday season, Stifel says. Highly anticipated games from marquee franchises--Activision Blizzard 's ""Call of Duty: Vanguard ,"" Electronic Arts ' ""Battlefield 2042"" and Take-Two's ""Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition""--all had disappointing launches in November, according to the investment firm's analysis of third-party data that measures audience and monetization trends. All three companies' shares have double-digit losses during 2021 while the S&P 500 is up close to 25%. Stifel says its intermediate and longer-term thesis on the industry overall is still positive, but from a trading perspective for the group, ""we're not anticipating any major shift in sentiment (bearish) between now and year end.""

1021 ET - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has finally found something to excite investors--IPOing its Mobileye self-driving car unit. Intel says it will float the business it bought a few years ago, while retaining a stake. Gelsinger has pledged to rebuild Intel 's chip edge and build up a contract chip-making business. None of that has found much investor love. After the Mobileye announcement, Intel is up more than 5%. (robert.wall@wsj.com)

1000 ET - Trade figures show strong global demand for US exports but volatility is to be expected, Amherst Pierpont's Stephen Stanley says after the Commerce Department reports a narrowing trade deficit. ""It is hard to know how much of the October move was simply an unwind of what was happening in prior months, especially on the export side,"" Stanley says. Given the persistence of logistics issues ""continued volatility feels like a good bet going forward."" He expects bottlenecks to ease for now, but warns that demand ""is outstripping the economy's capacity, pandemic or no pandemic."" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

0953 ET - US regulators are considering possible changes to the rules that govern individual investors' access to options, as a surge in trading of the complex instruments upends the stock market. Gaining approval to buy and sell options through some brokerages, such as Robinhood Markets Inc ., is significantly easier than at others, leading regulators to examine whether new rules are needed. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , or Finra, plans to publish a request for comment in coming weeks to solicit feedback from market participants about trading in options and other complex products, a spokesman for the body says. Such requests are often the first step regulators take when considering potential rule changes. (paul.kiernan@wsj.com @pkwsj)

0916 ET - Treasury yields rise as Omicron fears recede and investors embrace a little more risk. The 10-year is at 1.456%, up from 1.433% Monday. ""The covid data in South Africa is so far consistent with the assessment that Omicron is more transmissible, but less virulent,"" Deutsche Bank says, noting that ""data are subject to revisions and it is early days."" Investors also adjust to an expected acceleration of the reduction in bond purchases by the Fed, which will sap a major source of demand for government debt. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

""We believe that COP has a clear trajectory for high single-digit regular dividend growth as a baseline over the next five-years plus assuming current oil prices,"" Mizuho says.

(""Altria "") (NYSE:MO) today announces that it has been recognized for a second consecutive year with a double 'A' rating for tackling climate change and protecting water security by CDP, a non-profit that runs a global disclosure system on managing environmental impact. CDP's A List distinguishes companies for leadership on transparency and action on key environmental issues.

""We are committed to conserving the natural resources on which our businesses and communities rely,"" said Jennifer Hunter , Senior Vice President, Corporate Citizenship. ""As the latest science makes clear, the global community needs to quickly increase the ambition and progress of environmental targets, build climate resilient businesses and prepare for the net zero economy. Altria is committed to doing our part.""

In 2020, Altria announced its long-term 2030 targets from a 2017 baseline to: 


   -- Reduce absolute Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions by 55% 
 
   -- Reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 18% 
 
   -- Achieve 100% renewable electricity 
 
   -- Reduce waste sent to landfill by 25% 
 
   -- Achieve 100% water neutrality each year 

Altria has made a strong commitment to reducing its environmental impact, both in aligning operational and value chain business practices with science-based methodology to limit the damaging impacts of climate change and in reducing the environmental impact of using its companies' products.

Aligned with Altria 's disclosure on climate-related risks and opportunities in CDP Climate Change, this year, Altria also published its first standalone Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report. The TCFD was formed by the Financial Stability Board in 2015 to help companies provide decision-useful information about their climate-related risks and opportunities to investors. Altria is proud to be the first U.S tobacco company to join more than 2,700 supporters of the TCFD.

CDP's annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely recognized as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency. A detailed and independent methodology is used, allocating a score of A to D- based on the comprehensiveness of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets. Those that don't disclose or provided insufficient information are marked with an F.

Europe-based Unibail Rodamco Westfield in particular wants to get rid of certain U.S. assets to pay down debt it shouldered in 2018 to buy Westfield's portfolio, including the namesake malls in New York and San Francisco. Its borrowings are now equivalent to 16.6 times projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Reducing that to its target of nine times would allow the company to concentrate on its more attractive European business and might revive interest in its stock, which is down almost 60% since the start of 2020.

Major landlords have already started to cut losses on the weakest locations by handing them back to lenders, usually malls where the debt is worth more than the property itself. The Westfield Palm Desert mall, for example, was recently valued at $85 million and had $125 million of debt outstanding. Simon and Brookfield Property have also put what they consider no-hope malls into voluntary foreclosure.

In total, owners have handed over the keys to more than 20 U.S. malls since Covid-19 first spread, according to Green Street. But this is still only a fraction of America's so-called Grade B and C malls.

Some struggling properties could be converted to other uses. In April, landlord Macerich sold a stake in the Paradise Valley Mall in Phoenix for $100 million to a developer who plans to convert it into new homes and offices. Malls are usually built on large sites with decent access to infrastructure, so can be candidates for redevelopment. Westfield has approval to convert space in its New Jersey and Maryland malls into mixed-use properties, including homes. Another option is to turn them into e-commerce warehouses or distribution centres. Amazon has opened a new fulfillment facility in Ohio on an old mall site.

While these ideas look good on paper, only a trickle of sales and revamps have actually happened. Around 50 enclosed regional U.S. malls have been sold during the pandemic, according to a professional handling the auctions, most of them by lenders. The limited number of ""healthy"" malls sold may reflect unrealistic asking prices, the difficulty of getting finance for retail deals and the fact that converting them is capital intensive. Developers often prefer to buy land and avoid the expense and complexity of tearing down an old mall.

Landlords may be biding their time until footfall and occupancy rates recover from the pandemic in the hope of getting a better price. This makes sense considering Unibail said third-quarter sales in its U.S. malls were above 2019 levels. Shares in Simon Property , which mostly owns high-quality malls, are back above precrisis levels.

Some investors are making contrarian bets on the most tired malls. Real estate specialists Namdar Realty Group and Kohan Retail Investment Group have been buying assets cheaply and continuing to run them as retail locations. Turnbridge Equities made a killing earlier this year when it sold a North Carolina mall for $95 million to Fortnite's owner Epic Games for the company's new headquarters. It paid just $31.5 million for the property in 2019.

But landlords can't see such buyers as white knights. The opportunists prefer to snap up assets in distressed sales, paying a fraction of malls' old valuations. Until more buyers think there is money to be made in mall makeovers, the likes of Westfield have a tough sell on their hands.

ARLINGTON, Va., Dec. 7, 2021

ARLINGTON, Va., Dec. 7, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today announced the completion of the purchase of Valcour Wind Energy (Valcour) from global investment firm Carlyle (NASDAQ: CG). Valcour's six wind farms represent the largest operating wind platform in New York and play an important role in helping the state meet its commitment to have 70% of its electricity come from renewable resources by 2030.

The Valcour portfolio currently produces roughly 25% of the State of New York's wind power and includes: 


   -- Three wind parks in Clinton County totaling 279 MW 
 
   -- Two wind parks in Wyoming County totaling 227 MW 
 
   -- One wind park in Franklin County totaling 106 MW 

Cogentrix Energy , a Carlyle portfolio company, operated, maintained, and managed the portfolio since Carlyle's acquisition of Valcour in 2018. AES is assuming these responsibilities going forward.

""The State of New York is a leader in the transition to a smarter, greener energy future while ensuring communities gain the economic benefits of hosting renewable energy projects. With the acquisition of the Valcour wind portfolio and our more than two decades of experience in New York, we're proud to work together with state and local communities to help meet these admirable goals,"" said Leo Moreno, AES Clean Energy President. ""This wind portfolio complements our 1 GW solar pipeline in the state, allowing us to provide custom offerings such as our 24/7 product to realize a carbon-free energy grid. Thanks to the partnership between Carlyle, Cogentrix and Valcour, the Valcour portfolio also offers a strong platform upon which we can continue to build through repowering.""

Carlyle Managing Director J.B. Oldenburg said, ""We are proud to have partnered with the Cogentrix and Valcour teams to help New York State continue to make progress towards its clean energy goals. As Carlyle's first wind investment, this was a partnership where value creation and driving positive environmental change converged and we are thrilled for AES to build upon that impact. We believe the renewable and sustainable energy sector is at an inflection point and look forward to continuing to be a key contributor to progressing the transition.""

BRAMPTON, ON, Dec. 7, 2021 /CNW/ - Medtronic Canada ULC, a subsidiary of Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), the world's leading medical technology company, announced it has received a Health Canada licence for the Hugo(TM) robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system for use in use in urologic and gynecologic laparoscopic surgical procedures, which make up about half of all robotic procedures performed today.(1)

""This licence ushers in a new opportunity for healthcare in Canada, bringing the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery to more patients by addressing the historic cost and utilization barriers that have stifled robotic surgery adoption for two decades,"" said Megan Rosengarten , president of the Surgical Robotics business, which is part of the Medical Surgical Portfolio at Medtronic . ""We're beginning to see what the Hugo RAS system can do in the hands of clinicians in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and we're excited to see the possibilities it creates in Canada.""

Globally, about 3% of soft tissue surgeries are performed robotically, (1) despite offering patients the benefits of minimally invasive surgery -- fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and faster return to normal activities.(3--5,)

""Minimally invasive technology has a role to play in addressing the backlog of surgery in Canada. It can help optimize our precious healthcare human resources when patients spend less time in and out of the hospital, "" said Neil Fraser , president of Medtronic Canada. ""Today in Canada, only 1--2% percent of surgeries are performed with robotic assistance.(2) I'm proud that the launch of the Hugo system means we can help change that, and, more importantly, help to improve the patient and healthcare provider experience. Our first step will be to work with hospital partners to identify the best candidates for RAS based on patient outcomes and cost.""

A modular, multi-quadrant platform indicated for urologic surgical procedures and gynecologic laparoscopic surgical procedures, the Hugo RAS system combines wristed instruments, 3D visualization, and a cloud-based surgical video capture option in Touch Surgery(TM) Enterprise with dedicated support teams specializing in robotics program optimization, service, and training.

Health Canada licensing comes on the heels of major milestones in the Hugo RAS system global launch, including the receipt of CE Mark approval in Europe and the first urologic and gynecologic cases in Latin America and India, which are included in the Hugo(TM) RAS system patient registry.

The Hugo RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability. In the EU, the Hugo RAS system is CE marked. In Canada, the Hugo RAS system has a Health Canada licence. In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device not for sale. Touch Surgery Enterprise is not intended to direct surgery, or aid in diagnosis or treatment of a disease or condition.

Bank stocks rallied Monday, but not enough to make up for their post-Omicron losses.

Banks play a central role in the American economy, so the outlook for U.S. growth causes their stock prices to swing more than broader stock market indexes.

Some investors say that the recent bout of volatility hasn’t changed their optimism. They are betting that the U.S. economy will continue to rebound, which will keep fueling bank shares. Banks plunged at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but they have held up well since then, avoiding big losses in their consumer units and churning out profits in their Wall Street arms.

“It didn’t take much ingenuity to figure out that when the economy recovered, people would be interested in banks,” said Fredric E. Russell, founder of Fredric E. Russell Investment Management Co. in Tulsa, Okla.

Mr. Russell said he increased his clients’ holdings of Bank of America by about 50% a little more than a year ago. The bank’s stock has been on the upswing for most of the year, though it is down about 7% since Thanksgiving. Mr. Russell is concerned that the Omicron variant will impinge on economic growth, but hasn’t reduced his position in the stock.

Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. followed a similar pattern. They are all down since Thanksgiving, but still up more than the broader market this year.

Even with the recent declines, the KBW is up 36% this year through Monday. If that holds, it would be the index’s biggest annual gain since 1997.

Investors are trying to parse whether Omicron is just a temporary blip or a longer-term drag on the broader economy. They are also making bets on whether the highest inflation in decades will curb Americans’ ability to weather even a small downturn. That would challenge bank stocks, whose price gains already reflect the optimistic economic outlook, investors say.

Bank shares have taken a circuitous path since the pandemic began in the spring of 2020. Initially, fears of massive loan defaults forced the largest lenders to sock away tens of billions of dollars, which eroded their profits and depressed share prices. Shares rebounded after the banks said their loan portfolios were performing better than expected.

Now, though, banks are dealing with a different problem: lackluster loan demand. People stored up money when they had nowhere to go. Businesses borrowed by accessing the capital markets and taking forgivable loans from the government. Rock bottom interest rates also ate into interest income.

Recently, that has started to change. Net interest margins, the difference between what banks pay to borrow and what they earn from lending, rose in the third quarter from a record low, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Bank executives say they are also seeing signs that loan demand is picking up.

For many investors, the question of whether bank stocks can keep up the momentum hinges on whether the Federal Reserve’s expected rate rises can tame inflation without curbing growth.

“People are still buying into financial stocks on the expectation that there is going to be a rising rate environment,” said Dave Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors in Cincinnati.

For much of this year, he increased the amount of bank stocks in the actively managed exchange-traded funds he runs. He trimmed his holdings before Omicron hit.

TELUS expands strategic relationship with IBM to provide enterprises with fast, secure and reliable 5G industry solutions

VANCOUVER, BC and MARKHAM, ON, Dec. 7, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and TELUS (TSX: T, NYSE: TU) are deploying a Canada-wide 5G edge computing platform to enable enterprises across multiple industries to accelerate innovative solutions that deliver new value to their clients and operations. TELUS ' 5G edge computing platform, deployed as a Hybrid Multi-Cloud environment paired with IBM Cloud Satellite, extends secure and open cloud services to the edge of the network, helping customers improve business performance and customer experience while meeting critical data security and sovereignty requirements.

By harnessing the power of 5G to increase bandwidth and bring 'Compute + Connectivity' closer to the edge of the network, IBM and TELUS will provide enterprises with the flexibility to intelligently and automatically deploy and manage workloads where low latency and high bandwidth 5G connectivity are needed most.

""The pandemic has shown us how important highly secure and reliable connections are for Canadians, especially in a time of heightened digital transformation,"" said Claude Guay , president of IBM Canada. ""IBM is working closely with leaders like TELUS to use hybrid multi-cloud platforms, such as IBM Cloud Satellite, coupled with industry expertise to bring the power of 5G closer to the customers' data.

In 2008, French supermarket chain Carrefour faced a boycott ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics after protesters aiming to highlight Chinese repression in Tibet hassled Olympic torch carriers on their way through Paris. Japanese auto makers endured a boycott in 2012 after Tokyo nationalized the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in Chinese, which China also claims. More recently, H&M and other foreign clothing brands have faced pressure from netizens -- with an extra boost from official organs such as the Communist Youth League -- after they stopped sourcing from the Xinjiang region. This followed the imposition by the U.S. and Europe of sanctions on entities allegedly involved in human-rights abuses in Xinjiang, including widespread internments, sterilizations and the razing of thousands of religious sites. China has rejected allegations of mistreatment of the Uyghur population there.

Such boycotts have often had lasting, pernicious effects even before relations between China and the West entered their current nosedive. South Korean supermarket Lotte Mart was forced to exit China after operating there for over a decade in 2018 following a consumer boycott in response to South Korea's agreement to host a U.S. missile defense system. And Carrefour's Chinese operations are now owned by Suning, a Chinese brand. In an apparent dig at Walmart, Carrefour China's official account on Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social-media network, recently sported a post highlighting walnuts, cotton socks and apples labeled ""I come from Xinjiang.""

Yet the environment for many Western brands in China is clearly even more fraught now, with little prospect of substantive improvement.

H&M wasn't merely targeted -- it was more or less erased from the Chinese internet by companies such as Alibaba and Baidu. The increasing attention of U.S. lawmakers and the Western public to the Chinese government's human-rights abuses seems unlikely to go away. Meanwhile nationalist sentiment among the Chinese public -- and the willingness of officials to use strident rhetoric -- has rarely looked more pronounced.

At the same time that these ""push"" factors against Western companies in China are intensifying, the ""pull"" factors are ebbing. Thanks to a toxic combination of rising debt, lost income during the early months of Covid-19, high housing prices, repeated rounds of draconian measures to quash small Covid-19 outbreaks, and a brutal crackdown on some of the fastest-growing service-sector employers such as internet technology and real estate, Chinese consumption growth has rarely looked weaker and youth unemployment remains stubbornly high.

Real spending on consumer goods rose only 0.5% year over year in November, which, excluding the initial recovery from the pandemic in early and mid-2020, was the weakest since at least 2011.

For now, many if not most American companies are still planning expansions in China: A September survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that only around a 10th had reduced planned investments due to worries about boycotts. But if Chinese consumption growth remains stubbornly weak, that cost-benefit calculus could start to change quickly.

Walmart's troubles are a symptom of a much larger problem. If relations don't improve -- and Chinese consumption growth fails to recover soon -- more foreign businesses might decide to focus their growth plans on greener pastures with fewer deep political sinkholes.

But that fact conceals profound changes in the political and economic environment in China. If they persist, longstanding assumptions about consumer companies' need to invest in China -- or be left behind globally -- could start to unravel.

Politically tinged consumer boycotts in China have a long history. In 2008, French supermarket chain Carrefour faced a boycott ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics after protesters aiming to highlight Chinese repression in Tibet hassled Olympic torch carriers on their way through Paris. Japanese auto makers endured a boycott in 2012 after Tokyo nationalized the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in Chinese, which China also claims. More recently, H&M and other foreign clothing brands have faced pressure from netizens -- with an extra boost from official organs such as the Communist Youth League -- after they stopped sourcing from the Xinjiang region. This followed the imposition by the U.S. and Europe of sanctions on entities allegedly involved in human-rights abuses in Xinjiang, including widespread internments, sterilizations and the razing of thousands of religious sites. China has rejected allegations of mistreatment of the Uyghur population there.

Such boycotts have often had lasting, pernicious effects even before relations between China and the West entered their current nosedive. South Korean supermarket Lotte Mart was forced to exit China after operating there for over a decade in 2018 following a consumer boycott in response to South Korea's agreement to host a U.S. missile defense system. And Carrefour's Chinese operations are now owned by Suning, a Chinese brand. In an apparent dig at Walmart, Carrefour China's official account on Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social-media network, recently sported a post highlighting walnuts, cotton socks and apples labeled ""I come from Xinjiang.""

Yet the environment for many Western brands in China is clearly even more fraught now, with little prospect of substantive improvement.

H&M wasn't merely targeted -- it was more or less erased from the Chinese internet by companies such as Alibaba and Baidu. The increasing attention of U.S. lawmakers and the Western public to the Chinese government's human-rights abuses seems unlikely to go away. Meanwhile nationalist sentiment among the Chinese public -- and the willingness of officials to use strident rhetoric -- has rarely looked more pronounced.

Meanwhile, as China's economy is faltering due to a mix of mostly government policy-related factors, real spending on consumer goods rose only 0.5% year over year in November, which, excluding the initial recovery from the pandemic in early and mid-2020, was the weakest since at least 2011.

For now, many if not most American companies are still planning expansions in China: A September survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that only around a 10th had reduced planned investments due to worries about boycotts. But if Chinese consumption growth remains stubbornly weak, that cost-benefit calculus could start to change quickly.

Walmart's troubles are a symptom of a much larger problem. If relations don't improve -- and Chinese consumption growth fails to recover soon -- more foreign businesses might decide to focus their growth plans on greener pastures with fewer deep political sinkholes.",",WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WALMARTCL:XSGO,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,TWTR:XWBO,TWR:XFRA,TWTR:XSWX,TWTR.RM:MISX,TWTR:XMEX,TWTR:XNYS,0QZB:XLON,TWTR.KZ:XKAZ,TWTR34:BVMF,HMSA:XBER,HNNMY:PINX,HMB:XSWX,HM-B:XSTO,HMRZF:PSGM,0HBP:XLON,HMSB:XETR,0NPH:XLON,CAN:XMEX,CRRFY:PINX,CARR:XWBO,CRR:XMIL,CAR:XETR,CAR1:XFRA,CA:XSWX,CA:XPAR,CRERF:PSGM,",",wlmrt,twnit,henns,carfor,",",wlmrt,",,",0NPH:XLON,CAN:XMEX,CRRFY:PINX,CARR:XWBO,CRR:XMIL,CAR:XETR,CAR1:XFRA,CA:XSWX,CA:XPAR,CRERF:PSGM,0NPH:XLON,CAN:XMEX,CRRFY:PINX,CARR:XWBO,CRR:XMIL,CAR:XETR,CAR1:XFRA,CA:XSWX,CA:XPAR,CRERF:PSGM,HMSA:XBER,HNNMY:PINX,HMB:XSWX,HM-B:XSTO,HMRZF:PSGM,0HBP:XLON,HMSB:XETR,HMSA:XBER,HNNMY:PINX,HMB:XSWX,HM-B:XSTO,HMRZF:PSGM,0HBP:XLON,HMSB:XETR,TWTR:XWBO,TWR:XFRA,TWTR:XSWX,TWTR.RM:MISX,TWTR:XMEX,TWTR:XNYS,0QZB:XLON,TWTR.KZ:XKAZ,TWTR34:BVMF,TWTR:XWBO,TWR:XFRA,TWTR:XSWX,TWTR.RM:MISX,TWTR:XMEX,TWTR:XNYS,0QZB:XLON,TWTR.KZ:XKAZ,TWTR34:BVMF,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WALMARTCL:XSGO,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WALMARTCL:XSGO,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WALMARTCL:XSGO,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,","[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

(""Lucira"") (Nasdaq: LHDX), a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of transformative and innovative infectious disease test kits, announced a new distribution agreement for at least 600,000 tests in 2022 with Co-Defend, Inc. and Co-Protect, LLC, leading providers of customized health, safety, and wellness solutions.

""We want to make our first-of-its-kind test as widely available as possible so people don't have to choose between rapid antigen tests that can't reliably detect infection before symptoms and lab-based PCR tests that are difficult to access and take days to deliver results,"" said Erik Engelson , President and Chief Executive Officer of Lucira Health. ""Co-Defend and Co-Protect provides solutions to the biggest names in sports, entertainment and enterprise scaled businesses. Their extensive reach and L.A.-based distribution platform plus Lucira's innovative on-the-spot molecular test means more Americans will have access to the peace of mind of a reliable, real-time test result before attending an event, returning to work, or gathering with family and friends.""

Adrian Cottman, President and Co-Founder of Co-Defend, and COO/EVP of Co-Protect, stated, ""Rapid, point-of-care testing is a critical tool for infection prevention and should be included in every organization's health and safety protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. Our companies minimize business disruption and get people back to living in this 'new normal'. Lucira's superior testing technology combined with our broad distribution channels will make an immediate positive impact on public health.""

Lucira Check-It COVID-19 test kit has emergency authorization by FDA under EUA.

LUCIRA(TM) Test Kits

The Lucira(TM) Check-It (OTC) and All-in-One (Rx) test kits are Nucleic-Acid Amplification Tests (referred to as NAAT). The tests fit in the palm of your hand, extract genetic material from the virus and amplify it, similar to PCR lab tests, to detect the presence of virus earlier and more accurately than antigen tests. The test uses an approach called reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). It was designed and tested extensively for individuals to use independently and does not require a physician's prescription or supervised assistance. There is no additional equipment to purchase, such as a reader or instrument.

Each Lucira test kit contains everything needed to run one COVID-19 test. Users get the test device, two AA batteries, sample vial, swab, and simple instructions. The batteries are inserted into the device and the sample vial is placed in the test unit. The user then opens the test swab packet and rotates the swab five times in each nostril. The swab is then stirred in the sample vial, which is then gently pressed into the test unit to start the test. The ""ready"" light will blink until a ""positive"" or ""negative"" green light is illuminated within 30 minutes. In the US, Lucira also offers a free LUCI Pass(TM) digital verified test result back to a user's phone. LUCI Pass is accessed via text and does not require downloading an app. There is also an opt-in for public health reporting for users who wish to transmit their results to the relevant public health authorities.

In clinical trials, 100% of users successfully performed the test at home in about two minutes using Lucira's easy-to-use 'swab, stir and detect' Check-It test kit.

In a Community Trial setting, Lucira(TM) Check-It results were compared with the Hologic Panther Fusion, considered a high-sensitivity molecular test due to its low Limit of Detection (""LOD""). Lucira's accuracy was 98%, correctly detecting 385 out of 394 positive and negative samples in comparison to the Hologic Panther Fusion, excluding ten samples with very low levels of virus (those with very high PCR cycle thresholds of 37.5 or greater) that possibly no longer represented active infection. Comparative positive results agreed 97% of the time among this sample, and negative results agreed 98% of the time.

Last month, Lucira announced confirmation that its COVID-19 Check-It molecular self-test kits can detect 100% of Omicron variant genome sequences analyzed, including the ""stealth variant"". Lucira assays target viral sequence regions unaffected by the spike protein mutations found in Omicron, Delta and other Variants of Concern, allowing it to maintain its accuracy in the face of an evolving virus.

(""Victoria's Secret "" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: VSCO) today announced that it has entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (""ASR"") with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (""Goldman Sachs "") to repurchase $250 million of the Company's common stock. The Company also reaffirmed fourth quarter sales, operating income and earnings guidance.

Under the ASR, the Company will make an initial payment of $250 million to Goldman Sachs and will receive an initial delivery of approximately 4.1 million shares of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2021. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the term of the ASR less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the ASR. The final settlement of the ASR is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.

The Company reaffirmed the fourth quarter guidance provided on November 17, 2021 which forecasted sales to be in the range of flat to up 3% versus last year's fourth quarter sales of $2.100 billion, operating income to be in the range of $295 million to $335 million and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.65.

CEO Martin Waters commented, ""I am very pleased with our fourth quarter performance to date and believe we have solid plans in place for the balance of this holiday selling season. I was particularly encouraged by our sales growth during the peak shopping days over the Thanksgiving weekend and the large rush of business as we approached December 25(th) . Our stores are in a good inventory position as we begin our semi-annual sale and anniversary the positive stimulus impact on sales in January of last year. Performance has been broad-based across all of our businesses, and our stores channel has been a position of strength for our results. The teams have executed well and focused on what we can control in this challenging supply chain environment, and I could not be more proud of our efforts.""

Mr. Waters continued, ""Over the past few months, we have stabilized our business and created a platform for future growth while generating significant cash flow. Our financial stability and cash flow potential are pillars of strength and competitive advantages. With the unanimous support of our Board of Directors, we are announcing our first-ever share repurchase. We believe this share repurchase reflects our confidence in the Company and is another step on our journey to create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders.""

Fitch Ratings has affirmed ONEOK, Inc . (OKE) and ONEOK Partners, L.P .'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB'. Debt at OKE and ONEOK Partners is cross guaranteed. In addition, Fitch has affirmed OKE's Short-Term IDR and CP rating of 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The ratings reflect OKE's integrated natural gas liquids (NGL) footprint, significant size and scale, and diversity across several basins. Offsetting these factors are the volumetric risks and higher commodity risk than other midstream peers, though somewhat mitigated by a ratable hedging policy.

Key Rating Drivers

Strong NGL Market Position: OKE is the largest NGL takeaway provider in the Williston Basin, the STACK/SCOOP, and in the Texas Panhandle. It also has a large presence in the Permian. OKE has an extensive NGL infrastructure network that can move volumes from the Rockies, through the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast. The NGL segment, its largest, is sensitive to commodity price. This includes the NGL price differential between NGL hubs in the Mid-Continent and Mont Belvieu and the price of ethane compared to natural gas, driving ethane rejection.

Improvements in 2021: While OKE is diversified, its two largest regions are the Bakken/Rockies and Mid-Continent. With the current commodity prices and increased demand, OKE's volumes for NGLs in the Bakken/Rocky Mountain regions exceeded pre-coronavirus levels, as of 2Q21. OKE reported in 3Q21 that the NGL segment had raw feed throughput volumes in the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent that rose over 40% and 14% YTD, respectively. The NGL segment is the largest at around 60% of EBITDA.

In the Rocky Mountains, OKE processed over 22% more natural gas in 3Q21 when compared with 2020. Oneok 's Rockies volumes exceeded the peaks prior to the coronavirus pandemic while the Mid-Con volumes were still below previous highs. In the current commodity environment, rig counts in the Bakken are above the 14-15 rigs and 300 well completions to maintain flat volumes. As of the third quarter, the 17 rigs on Oneok's dedicated acreage, coupled with additional volumes from the rising gas to oil ratio, support Fitch's forecast of increased volumes in 2022.

New Infrastructure Drives Cash Flows: Minimal capital is needed to absorb future volume growth, as the system has capacity to absorb it. Within the last 18 months, OKE completed a number of growth projects that drive volumes and cash flows. In the gathering and processing segment, it completed two processing plants in the Williston Basin and restarted the paused construction of another processing plant. In the NGL segment, it completed the Elk Creek Pipeline and expansion in December 2019 and 2020. Total pipeline capacity out of the Rockies region of approximately 440,000 bpd is about 70% utilized.

In March 2021, the 530-mile NGL pipeline Arbuckle II pipeline increased capacity to 500,000 bpd and has capacity to absorb the 5% quarter over quarter increase in 3Q21 NGLs over 2Q21 from the Permian/Gulf Coast. The 125,000 bpd MB-4 NGL fractionator was completed in March 2020 and OKE is investing an additional $250 million to restart construction of the paused $750 million MB-5 fractionator plant.

Improving Leverage: At the end of 2020, OKE's leverage (defined as total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA) was 5.1x largely driven by increases in debt used to fund significant growth projects, totaling $3.8 billion in 2019. Capex will fall in 2021 to between $600 million-$700 million, and increased volumes will move EBITDA up, turning FCF marginally positive. Leverage for the trailing twelve months ended 3Q2021 improved to 4.3x.

Fitch expects, based on its price deck, higher volumes, increased cash flows and capex in the range of $800 million to $900 million. Leverage is forecast to fall to the low 4x range by the end of 2021, an improvement over Fitch's previous expectation of mid-4.0x, and remain at this level through the forecast. With the commodity tailwinds, management projects leverage to decline below its targeted range of 4.0x, generating FCF to fund its growth capex projects.

Volume Risk: While about 85%-95% of the revenues from OKE's three segments -- NGL, gathering and processing (G&P) and natural gas pipelines -- are generated under fee-based contracts, the majority are subject to volume risk. The risk was demonstrated during 2020, when, similar to others in the midstream sector, OKE was affected by reduced supply and demand. Second-quarter 2020 (2Q20) volumes and cash flows dropped and 2Q20 EBITDA fell 24% compared with 1Q20.

The NGL and G&P segments (combined about 85% of EBITDA) are most exposed. Additionally, about 15% of the G&P business has commodity price risk, which OKE hedges on a rolling basis. Some revenue assurance is provided by the natural gas pipeline segment (15% of EBITDA), generating revenues under fee-based demand charge contracts and the NGL pipelines that are supported by some MVCs.

Parent Subsidiary Linkage: Fitch rates the IDRs of OKE and Oneok Partners on a consolidated basis under its Parent Subsidiary Ratings Linkage Criteria. Oneok Partners is a consolidated subsidiary of OKE. Fitch considers Oneok Partners to be stronger compared with OKE. The debt of Oneok Partners is guaranteed by OKE with cross guarantees by Oneok Partners for OKE's obligations. The ring fencing is open as there are minimal limitations between the two entities. In terms of access and control, Fitch considers it open given, for example, the pooled cash management between the entities.

Derivation Summary

Both OKE and Kinder Morgan, Inc . (KMI) are geographically diversified midstream issuers that are rated 'BBB.' OKE is smaller, generating roughly half the EBITDA of KMI. KMI's business risk is lower, benefitting from its long-haul FERC regulated pipeline that generate revenue under take-or-pay contracts, offsetting the higher leverage profile. The average of yearend leverage at OKE is 4.1x while KMI has been closer to 5.0x. KMI's leverage is expected to be around 5.0x at year-end 2022 while Fitch forecasts OKE's to be closer to 4.0x.

Another peer is The Williams Companies, Inc . (WMB), similarly rated 'BBB'. OKE is slightly smaller in size than Williams. WMB is more geographically diverse with a nationwide presence and has a lower business risk, with about half of its EBITDA from natural gas pipelines regulated by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Fitch considers the FERC one of the most supportive regulatory bodies in the U.S. Historically, WMB has had much higher leverage, offsetting the more favorable business profile. Fitch expects WMB to have leverage at the end of 2022 of about 4.8x -- higher than the Fitch forecast for OKE.

Key Assumptions

Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer

--The Fitch price deck for oil and natural gas informs the price assumptions for NGLs, natural gas and the unhedged volumes;

--EBITDA grows in 2021 due to new assets coming in service from 2020-2021;

--Further EBITDA expansion occurs in 2022 as volumes continue to improve;

--Distributions are held flat;

--Total capex returns to a normal range of $900 million to $1 billion.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:

--Leverage (defined as total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA) forecast at or below 3.7x on a sustained basis;

--An increase in the portion of EBITDA coming from revenue assurance-type contracts sustained over the forecast.

Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:

--Leverage (defined as total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA) forecast at or above 4.7x on a sustained basis;

--Unfavorable changes in the business mix or financial policies that result in a weaker credit profile.

Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario

International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

Liquidity and Debt Structure

Ample Liquidity: OKE has a $2.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in June 2024. As of Sept. 30, 2021, OKE had cash on hand of approximately $224 million and full availability under its revolver. The credit agreement has a leverage covenant that requires the company to have debt to EBITDA ratio lower than 5.0x. The agreement was amended in June 2020 to allow the company to net up to $700 million in cash on hand against its consolidated indebtedness for the purpose of its covenant calculation for the last three quarters of 2020. OKE was in compliance with its covenants as of Sept. 30, 2021 and leverage as defined by the bank agreement was 4.3x.

OKE's maturities are manageable with its nearest maturities coming in 4Q22. The February 2022 notes were repaid in November of 2021. The company has $925 million of senior notes due in 2023 and $500 million in 2024 and 2025.

Summary of Financial Adjustments

Regarding unconsolidated affiliates, Fitch calculates midstream energy companies' EBITDA by use of cash distributions from those affiliates, rather than by use of equity in earnings. Non-cash mark-to-market expenses of various types are added back to the base profit figure to arrive at adjusted EBITDA.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC , the broker-dealer subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase , was fined $200 million for ""widespread and longstanding failures"" to keep records of employees' written communications, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday. The failures in internal controls and record-keeping of employee communications, which the SEC said violated federal securities laws, carry negative implications for the bank's governance record.

The company also works with local governments in cities including Kansas City, Mo., and Baltimore.

The Lexington, Ky., company markets itself as a technology-driven alternative to traditional waste management. Rubicon aggregates large amounts of data to match a customer's trash and recycling to the appropriate outlet, its founder and chief executive, Nate Morris, said.

""That data is what I think has been so powerful,"" he said. ""We're running a play that we've seen work in every other industry.""

Rubicon investors include Mr. DiCaprio, Salesforce.com Inc. co-Chief Executive Marc Benioff, KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis and billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones.

The deal adds to the flurry of startups that are using SPAC mergers to inject cash into their businesses, allowing investors across Wall Street and Silicon Valley to make bets on companies that work to reduce carbon emissions.

SPAC mergers have exploded in the past few years, in part because they allow companies going public to make business projections that aren't allowed in traditional initial public offerings. Also called a blank-check company, a SPAC is a shell entity that raises money and trades on a stock exchange with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. After the private firm files detailed financial statements with regulators and the deal is approved, it replaces the SPAC in the stock market.

Despite heightened regulatory scrutiny of SPACs and recent share-price declines, new blank-check companies continue to rake in money. Nearly 600 SPACs have raised roughly $160 billion this year, eclipsing the total combined amount raised by blank-check companies through 2020, according to SPAC Research.

Rubicon, which was founded in 2008, is raising a $111 million PIPE, or private investment in public equity, as part of the SPAC merger. The PIPE investors include data-mining software firm Palantir Technologies Inc. and the government-backed New Zealand Super Fund.

That money and the roughly $320 million held by Founder SPAC, which went public in October, is to be used in an effort to accelerate the company's growth, though SPAC investors can withdraw their money before the merger goes through. Such withdrawals have skyrocketed recently, with shares of many SPACs slumping.

Rubicon expects to post roughly $575 million in sales this year, a figure the company projects will rise steadily in the years ahead.",",WMTCL:XSGO,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,",",wlmrt,tioqkt,sbcoff,palanc,kkr,applc,",",wlmrt,tioqkt,",,",WMTCL:XSGO,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,WMTCL:XSGO,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,WMTCL:XSGO,WMT:XNYS,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XSGO,WALM34:BVMF,WMT:XBOG,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WMT:XSWX,WMT:XBUE,","Waste and recycling platform Rubicon Technologies LLC is merging with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public at a valuation of roughly $2 billion, the companies said.

Rivian Automotive is turning its heavy financial backing into bigger production capability. The electric-vehicle startup plans to start construction next year on a second U.S. manufacturing facility in Georgia, the WSJ's Ben Foldy reports, in a $5 billion manufacturing investment that amounts to a hefty bet on its ability to increase sales . The upstart auto manufacturer says the factory will have an annual capacity of 400,000 vehicles and will start production in 2024. That's a big step for a company that just started producing electric pickup trucks at its Illinois plant in September. But the company in its first quarterly earnings report since its IPO last month says it had $5.2 billion in cash on hand, up from $3.6 billion a year earlier. It plans to release two more models this year: an SUV and a delivery van built for Amazon, which owns an 18% stake in Rivian.

E-Commerce

The shopping district for online marketplaces is getting crowded. The list of retailers, apparel sellers and even grocery chains operating digital channels for third-party sellers is expanding, the WSJ's Jinjoo Lee writes in a Heard on the Street column, as companies jump on a bandwagon that offers higher sales revenue without the cost of inventory . The marketplaces allow third-party sellers to list, sell and ship items on an established retailer's site. Amazon was the pioneer in the strategy, and lately department stores Macy's and Hudson's Bay, grocery chain Kroger and clothing seller J.Crew have created or are launching marketplaces. The efforts can generate meaningful revenue, but they carry risks. A poor shipping experience can sour customer perceptions of a retailer. They can also trigger confusion over returns logistics if shoppers can't return unwanted purchases to the owner of the digital sales channel.

FedEx's revenue growth is coming at a higher cost. The delivery giant's overall revenue rose 14% in the fiscal second quarter ending Nov. 30, but operating expenses rose even faster, the WSJ's Paul Ziobro reports, as higher wages, added costs for outside transportation procurement and other inefficiencies ate into profit margins . The revenue growth came largely on pricing strength. Average daily package volume in the express business fell 6% from a year ago but revenue per package in that segment was 11% ahead of last year's yield. The margins at the ground unit at the heart of e-commerce business fell, however, and operating income there contracted 13% despite a 13% increase in revenue. FedEx upgraded its outlook for the full fiscal year, however, suggesting the company believes ongoing strong demand and pricing will deliver better returns during the current critical peak holiday quarter.",",WMT:XBUE,0R1W:XLON,WMT:XBOG,WMTCL:XSGO,WMT:XLIM,WMT:XMEX,WMT:XSGO,WMT:XWBO,WMT:XETR,WMT:XNYS,WMT:XSWX,WALM34:BVMF,AIR:XETR,0KVV:XLON,EADSY:PINX,AIR:XMAD,EADSF:PSGM,AIR:XWBO,AIRA:XFRA,AIR:XSWX,AIR:XPAR,AIRN:XMEX,AIR:XMIL,AIR:XBUL,0JS2:XLON,KR:XMEX,KR:XWBO,K1RC34:BVMF,KR:XNYS,KR-RM:MISX,KOG:XFRA,RIVN:XNAS,",1639742560920,",xf500,",,,,",RIVN:XNAS,",NAMZ USA ,,1639742566000,1670217331398,Dow Jones Institutional News,en,",usa,namz,",,,,",wlmrt,ulvr,twnit,sealan,qntas,pclb,nia,krogr,kamna,jfoskv,hubyc,gzymkm,genpt,ftgrp,feds,fdexps,exeljl,djjqrp,conter,cmqmms,boeing,amzcom,",DJDN,DJDN000020211217ehch0016u,917,",amzcom,amzcom,boeing,boeing,cmqmms,cmqmms,conter,conter,djjqrp,djjqrp,exeljl,exeljl,fdexps,fdexps,feds,feds,ftgrp,genpt,genpt,gzymkm,gzymkm,hubyc,hubyc,jfoskv,jfoskv,kamna,kamna,krogr,krogr,nia,nia,pclb,pclb,qntas,qntas,sealan,sealan,twnit,ulvr,ulvr,wlmrt,wlmrt,fdexps,jfoskv,oyqpni,",",iadrive,icargo,iretail,i64,iaut,itech,itsp,i351,i35104,i78,",Logistics Report: FedEx's Costly Growth; Rivian Adds a Factory; Retailers Seek Online Sellers,1639742560920,"Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",add,article,"['WMT', 'KR']",,2021-12-17,1639742594262

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 17, 2021--S&P Global Ratings today said 
that FedEx Corp .'s (BBB/Stable/--) authorization to repurchase up to $5 
billion of stock, including a $1.5 billion accelerated repurchase program 
(ASR), will temper improvement in credit measures this year. We nevertheless 
anticipate the company will generate robust cash flow and that credit measures 
will be consistent with expectations for the rating, including funds from 
operations to debt near 30%. 
 
FedEx  is experiencing extraordinarily high volume due to strong economic 
activity and e-commerce growth, though EBITDA margins have not rebounded as 
strongly. The company cites labor market limitations as contributing to higher 
costs and system inefficiencies. We expect a combination of rate increases and 
easing labor constraints to result in margin improvement in the second half 
fiscal 2022 ending in May. We view the company's ability to achieve margin 
gains and the pace at which it executes remaining buybacks as key to potential 
improvement in credit quality. We expect the company to fund repurchases under 
the authorization, which are in addition to $748 million bought back so far 
this year, with a combination of internally generated cash flow and a portion 
of the $6.8 billion of cash on hand at the end of November. 
 
This report does not constitute a rating action.

The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings: 
 
OVERVIEW 
 
     -- We have assigned our 'A+' rating to Luminis Finance' series 2021-6 
range accrual notes due 2050. 
     -- Our rating is weak-linked to lowest rated credit counterparty, 
currently Goldman Sachs International  as swap counterparty and expenses payer. 
     -- Luminis Finance is a segregated multiple-issuance special-purpose 
entity established in Ireland. The transaction repackages senior unsecured 
bond issued by the State of Israel. 
LONDON (S&P Global Ratings) Dec. 17, 2021--S&P Global Ratings has assigned its 
'A+' credit rating to Luminis Finance PLC's series 2021-6 notes due in 2050. 
Luminis Finance is a segregated multiple-issuance special-purpose entity 
established in Ireland. 
 
At closing, Luminis Finance issued the series 2021-6 notes, and used the 
proceeds to purchase a senior unsecured $31.5 million bond (ISIN: 
US46513JB429) issued by the State of Israel and rated 'AA-'. At the same time, 
the issuer entered into a 2002 ISDA master agreement and schedule with Goldman 
Sachs International  (GSI), as swap counterparty. Under the swap, the issuer 
received $34 million. 
 
On an ongoing basis, Luminis Finance will pay to the swap counterparty the 
amount of interest received from the bond, while the swap counterparty will 
pay an amount in euro to pay the interest due on the notes, one the day before 
the rated notes' payment date. 
 
On each interest payment date, the interest amount due is linked to a formula: 
3.35% multiplied by the number of days when the euro to U.S. dollar rate is 
below 1.5 during the quarter multiplied by the day count multiplied by 
(25,000,000/21,000,000). 
 
Regarding the interest payments under the notes, we view the ordinary foreign 
exchange fluctuation as ordinary risk when assessing fixed income securities. 
Furthermore, in our view, the interest amount is based on a component that is 
determined by an independent third party. We also looked at the historical 
performance of the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate as part of the rating 
consideration, and we consider the trigger breach to be in line with the 
rating assigned. 
 
Under the transaction documents GSI will pay the ongoing fees and expenses for 
this transaction, and any other fees and expenses that might arise. 
 
The Bank of New York  Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch is the custodian. 
 
In accordance with our repack criteria, we have weak-linked our rating on the 
repack notes to the lower of: 
     -- Our 'AA-' rating on the senior unsecured bond, issued by the State of 
Israel (ISIN: US46513JB429); 
     -- Our 'A+' issuer credit rating (ICR) on GSI as swap counterparty and 
fee payer; and 
     -- Our 'AA-' ICR on Bank of New York Mellon  (Luxembourg Branch)(The) as 
custodian, which we derive from our ICR on Bank of New York Mellon  (The) as 
branch parent. 
 
We will maintain surveillance on the transaction until the notes mature. 
 
The key performance indicators for the rating on the notes are: 
     -- The long-term ICR on the swap counterparty and fees payer; 
     -- The long-term ICR associated with the collateral bond issuer; and 
     -- The long-term ICR on the custodian. 
 
A rating action on one of the counterparties above could have a direct and 
material effect on the ratings on the respective series of notes.

             low seven figures. 
 
   -- For each product candidate, Dyadic could receive development and 
      regulatory milestones in the mid-seven figures. 
 
   -- Dyadic could receive commercial milestone payments in the low nine 
      figures per product, subject to a limit on the number of such products. 
      The amount will depend on the cumulative amount of active pharmaceutical 
      ingredient produced by Janssen for each product manufactured with 
      Dyadic's C1 platform.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 17, 2021-- 

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.

The positive opinion is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 trial, in which KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% (HR=0.68 [95% CI, 0.53-0.87]; p=0.0010) compared to placebo, in patients at increased risk of recurrence (defined in the clinical trial protocol as intermediate-high or high-risk following nephrectomy and those with resected advanced disease). The CHMP's recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union , and a final decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022.

""Patients in Europe with earlier-stage renal cell carcinoma, who are at increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, have not had an approved treatment option in the adjuvant setting that can help reduce the risk of their cancer returning,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories . ""This positive CHMP opinion for KEYTRUDA is an important step forward in bringing adjuvant immunotherapy to these patients and demonstrates Merck's progress in providing new options to treat earlier stages of cancer.""

Merck has a broad clinical development program exploring KEYTRUDA, as monotherapy or in combination, as well as several other investigational and approved medicines across multiple settings and stages of RCC, including adjuvant and advanced or metastatic disease.

About Renal Cell Carcinoma

Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men than in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 431,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 179,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.

About Merck's Early-Stage Cancer Clinical Program

Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.

About KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

KEYTRUDA With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT >=3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT >=3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT >=3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

Adrenal Insufficiency

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

Hypophysitis

17 Dec 2021 06:45 ET 
Press Release: Merck Receives Positive EU CHMP -3-

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti--PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

While the number is very large, Fed officials have signaled no concern about the level of usage and say reverse repos are working as they should. Private-sector economists have tied the large usage of reverse repos--which pay eligible firms 0.05% to take in the cash--to Fed bond-buying creating excess liquidity. But even as the central bank has pared back on asset purchases, there's been no pullback for the facility. (michael.derby@wsj.com)

1348 ET - Accenture 's ""remarkably positive"" quarter sets up the rest of FY22, Citi says after company reported 1Q results above analyst views and boosted its outlook. Citi says ""performance continues to surprise positively to the upside. Accenture beat the upper end of its outlook by more than $600M and sharply raised its forward outlook.""

1329 ET - On-time performance for FedEx , UPS and the US Postal Service continues to hold steady, according to parcel analytics firm ShipMatrix, with the latter two carriers outpacing FedEx . From Dec. 5 to 11, on-time scores came in at 84.8% for FedEx , 95.8% for UPS and 95% for the Postal Service. All aren't too far off than what each carrier posted in the previous two weeks. ShipMatrix notes the Postal Service is showing the biggest improvement from last year since it's added extra shipping capacity, among other reasons. The firm also adds FedEx 's underperformance is in part because UPS and the Postal Service added an extra day to delivery times during the peak season. (paul.ziobro@wsj.com; @pziobro)

1245 ET - GM shares drop more than 5% in the wake of news late Thursday that CEO of its Cruise driverless-car division, Dan Ammann , is out.

1406 ET - Enghouse's valuation upside will be determined by the software company's ability to make earnings-accretive acquisitions, according to Scotiabank. ""Upside in the stock is largely centered on management's ability to deploy capital toward acquisitions while maintaining at least neutral growth in the core business,"" the investment bank says. Enghouse says it has a healthy pipeline, but that increased valuations in the broader software sector made closing transactions more difficult in 2021. Scotiabank expects Enghouse will remain disciplined and continue to follow its proven M&A playbook, and says that deployed capital will likely be lower in 2022 given the lower levels seen in this year. Scotiabank lowers the target price on the stock to C$58 from C$65. Shares fall 4% to C$46.30.

",",c181,cacqu,ccat,neqac,npag,reqrcm,c18,cactio,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,redit,reqr,",,1664600329000,"Based in Kansas City, Mo., Cerner designs software that hospitals and doctors use to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data. It has a market value of around $23 billion. With a typical takeover premium, a deal would be expected to value the company at something like $30 billion, though exact terms being discussed couldn't be learned.

Oracle, a Silicon Valley veteran that last year moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, is one of the biggest software providers to other companies and organizations.

In August, Cerner tapped David Feinberg as chief executive officer, a role he assumed in October.

Mr. Feinberg came from Oracle rival Google, where he had led the Alphabet Inc. unit's push into healthcare and helped strike partnerships with some of the country's largest hospital systems to collect and analyze their data.

Oracle already has a significant presence in healthcare, offering technology meant to help health insurers, healthcare providers and public health systems parse data to increase efficiency and improve patient outcomes.

Oracle shares closed Thursday at $103.22, down slightly amid a broad-based tech selloff and just off a record reached the day before. They jumped more than 15% last week when the company reported fiscal-second-quarter results that topped estimates and Chief Executive Safra Catz reiterated the expectation that full-year revenue growth would accelerate from the year earlier.

Ms. Catz, who became the sole CEO in 2019, said she expects the company's operating margins to be the same or better than they were pre-pandemic.

The company also increased the authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion.

Buying Cerner could help Oracle with its pivot toward the cloud.

Investors have warmed to Oracle as the company increases its focus on winning cloud-computing business, after initially being slow to embrace the booming market for storing and analyzing data on remote servers.

Oracle has been trying to make up ground in recent years after falling behind companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which both now have market values well exceeding $1 trillion thanks in part to thriving cloud units.

A deal for Cerner would follow Microsoft's agreement in April to buy artificial-intelligence company Nuance Communications Inc. for $16 billion, in a bet on the growing demand for digital healthcare tools.

Oracle was founded by billionaire Larry Ellison and others in 1977. Mr. Ellison owns roughly 42% of the company's shares, a stake that is valued at well over $100 billion. Mr. Ellison passed the CEO reins to Ms. Catz and the late Mark Hurd in 2014 but remains chairman and chief technology officer.

A deal for Cerner would easily top Oracle's next-largest transaction, the roughly $10 billion purchase of enterprise-software firm PeopleSoft Inc. that closed in 2005, followed by a $9 billion deal for cloud-software provider NetSuite Inc. in 2016.

In 2020, Oracle showed an appetite for bigger deals when it beat out Microsoft in bidding for the video-sharing app TikTok's U.S. operations.

The Trump administration's concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership had effectively put the business in play, but the deal was put on hold indefinitely by the Biden administration.

Cerner, founded in 1979, competes with the likes of privately held Epic Systems Corp. and Athenahealth Inc., which recently agreed to a sale to one group of private-equity firms by another for around $17 billion including debt.

Cerner shares rose slightly to $79.49 Thursday.

An Oracle-Cerner deal would rank as one of the largest takeovers of 2021, which is shaping up to be one of the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions.

Merger activity in the U.S. is up 78% to $2.45 trillion, according to Dealogic, as lofty stock prices and easy money embolden companies to strike deals and special-purpose acquisition companies are formed at a breakneck pace.",",ORCL:XNYS,ORCL:XSWX,ORCL:XWBO,ORC:XFRA,ORCL34:BVMF,ORCL-RM:MISX,0R1Z:XLON,ORCLCL:XSGO,ORCL:XBUE,ORCL:XSGO,ORCL:XMEX,",",viscmp,pplsft,orcle,netldg,mcrost,goog,epcsys,cerne,athenh,amzcom,",",orcle,cerne,",,",ORCL:XNYS,ORCL:XSWX,ORCL:XWBO,ORC:XFRA,ORCL34:BVMF,ORCL-RM:MISX,0R1Z:XLON,ORCLCL:XSGO,ORCL:XBUE,ORCL:XSGO,ORCL:XMEX,ORCL:XNYS,ORCL:XSWX,ORCL:XWBO,ORC:XFRA,ORCL34:BVMF,ORCL-RM:MISX,0R1Z:XLON,ORCLCL:XSGO,ORCL:XBUE,ORCL:XSGO,ORCL:XMEX,ORCL:XNYS,ORCL:XSWX,ORCL:XWBO,ORC:XFRA,ORCL34:BVMF,ORCL-RM:MISX,0R1Z:XLON,ORCLCL:XSGO,ORCL:XBUE,ORCL:XSGO,ORCL:XMEX,","Oracle Corp. is in talks to buy electronic-medical-records company Cerner Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that could be valued at around $30 billion and push the enterprise-software maker further into healthcare.
